<h3>PREFACE.</h3>


<p>It has been my ambition for many years to write
a history of Norway, chiefly because no such book,
worthy of the name, exists in the English language.
When the publishers of the present volume proposed
to me to write the story of my native land, I therefore
eagerly accepted their offer. The story, however,
according to their plan, was to differ in some
important respects from a regular history. It was to
dwell particularly upon the dramatic phases of historical
events, and concern itself but slightly with the
growth of institutions and sociological phenomena.
It therefore necessarily takes small account of proportion.
In the present volume more space is
given to the national hero, Olaf Tryggvesson, whose
brief reign was crowded with dramatic events, than
to kings who reigned ten times as long. For
the same reason the four centuries of the Union
with Denmark are treated with comparative brevity.
Many things happened, no doubt, during those centuries,
but "there were few deeds." Moreover, the
separate history of Norway, in the time of her degradation,
has never proved an attractive theme to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Norse historians, for which reason the period has
been generally neglected.</p>

<p>The principal sources of which I have availed myself
in the preparation of the present volume, are
Snorre Sturlasson: <i>Norges Kongesagaer</i> (Christiania,
1859, 2 vols.); P. A. Munch: <i>Det Norske Folks Historie</i>
(Christiania, 1852, 6 vols.); R. Keyser: <i>Efterladte
Skrifter</i> (Christiania, 1866, 2 vols.); <i>Samlede
Afhandlinger</i> (1868); J. E. Sars: <i>Udsigt over den
Norske Historie</i> (Christiania, 1877, 2 vols.); K.
Maurer: <i>Die Bekehrung des Norwegischen Stammes
zum Christenthume</i> (M&uuml;nchen, 1856, 2 vols.), and <i>Die
Entstehung des Isl&auml;ndischen Staates</i> (M&uuml;nchen, 1852);
G. Vigfusson: <i>Sturlunga Saga</i> (Oxford, 1878, 2 vols.);
and <i>Um t&iacute;matal &iacute; Islendinga s&ouml;gum i forn&ouml;ld</i> (contained
in <i>Safn til s&ouml;gu Islands</i>, 1855); G. Storm:
<i>Snorre Sturlasson's Historieskrivning</i> (Kj&ouml;benhavn,
1878); C. F. Allen: <i>Haandbog i F&aelig;drelandets Historie</i>
(Kj&ouml;benhavn, 1863); besides a large number of scattered
articles in German and Scandinavian historical
magazines. A question which has presented many
difficulties is the spelling of proper names. To adopt
in every instance the ancient Icelandic form would
scarcely be practicable, because the names in their
modernized forms are usually familiar and easy to
pronounce, while, in their Icelandic disguises, they
are to English readers nearly unpronounceable, and
present a needlessly forbidding appearance. Where
a name has no well-recognized English equivalent, I
have therefore adopted the modern Norwegian form,
which usually differs from the ancient, in having
dropped a final letter. Thus Sigurdr (which with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
English genitive would be Sigurdr's) becomes in
modern Norwegian Sigurd, Eirikr, Erik, etc. Those
surnames, which are descriptive epithets, I have
translated where they are easily translatable, thus
writing Harold the Fairhaired, Haakon the Good,
Olaf the Saint, etc. Absolute consistency would,
however, give to some names a too cumbrous look,
as, for instance, Einar the Twanger of Thamb
(Thamb being the name of his bow), and I have
in such instances kept the Norse name (Thambarskelver).</p>

<p>It is a pleasant duty to acknowledge my indebtedness
for valuable criticism to my friends, E. Munroe
Smith, J.U.D., Adjunct Professor of History in
Columbia College, and Hon. Rasmus B. Andersen,
United States Minister to Denmark, without whose
kindly aid in procuring books, maps, etc., the difficulties
in the preparation of the present volume
would have been much increased. I am also under
obligation to Dr. W. H. Carpenter, of Columbia
College, and to the Norwegian artist, Mr. H. N.
Gausta, of La Crosse, Wis., who has kindly sent me
two spirited original compositions, illustrative of
peasant-life in Norway.</p>

<h3>WHO WERE THE NORSEMEN?</h3>


<p>The Norsemen are a Germanic race, and belong,
accordingly, to the great Aryan family. Their next
of kin are the Swedes and Danes. Their original
home was Asia, and probably that part of Asia
which the ancients called Bactria, near the sources
of the rivers Oxus and Jaxartes. Not only the
Norsemen are supposed to have come from this
region, but the ancestors of all the Aryan nations
which now inhabit the greater portion of the civilized
world. Among the first to leave this cradle of
nations were the tribes which settled upon the
eastern islands and peninsulas of the Mediterranean,
and, under the name of Hellenes, developed, long
before the Christian era, an art and a literature which
are, in some respects, yet unrivalled. The early
Italic tribes, from which sprung in time the world-empire
of Rome, trace their descent from the same
ancestry; as do also the Kelts, who in ancient times
inhabited England, Ireland, and France; the Slavs
who settled in the present Russia, Bohemia, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
northern Turkish provinces; and the Germans, who
occupied the great central regions of the European
continent. Among Asiatic nations, the Iranians
inhabiting Persia, and the Hindoos in India, have
Aryan blood.</p>

<p>It seems almost incredible that persons differing
so widely in appearance, habits, and disposition, as,
for instance, a Hindoo and an Englishman, should,
if you go sufficiently far back, have the same ancestry.
And yet there cannot be the slightest doubt
that such is the case. The question, then, naturally
arises: "If they were once alike, what can have
made them so different?" And the answer is:
"The climate, the soil, and the general character of
the countries in which they settled."</p>

<p>The country from which the first Aryans emigrated
was mountainous, with fertile valleys, and an
even, temperate climate. There was no excessive
heat to make men drowsy and indolent, nor excessive
cold to stunt them in their growth and paralyze
their energies. The earth did not, as in the tropics,
produce a luxurious vegetation which would support
the inhabitants without labor, but it offered sustenance
to herds of cattle which, with the proper
care, would supply the simple needs of primitive
men. The race, thus situated, progressed physically
as well as mentally, until it became superior to all
the tribes inhabiting the neighboring regions. War
followed, in which the weaker succumbed. The
Aryans, increasing rapidly in numbers, took possession
of the conquered territories, enslaved the
indigenous population, or drove it back into locali<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>ties
where the conditions of life were less favorable.
It is not positively known when the first migration
on a large scale took place; but some scholars have
supposed that the Hindoos separated from the parent
race as early as 1500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The dates of the Greek,
Italic, Keltic, and Slavic migrations are likewise uncertain,
and the period which has been fixed upon
for the Aryan occupation of Germany is also conjectural.
The same uncertainty prevails regarding
the earliest history of the Scandinavian tribes; although
there is a strong probability that their invasion
of the countries which they now inhabit must
have taken place during the second century preceding
the Christian era. It is not unlikely that they left
their Asiatic home simultaneously with the Germans,
with whom they were then almost, if not entirely,
identical, and that their conquering hordes spread
northward, subduing the Finns and Lapps, whom
they found in possession of the land, partly exterminating
them, partly forcing them up into the barren
mountains of the extreme North. Among the tribes
whose path of conquest was turned in this direction,
the Goths (<i>Gauter</i>), the Swedes (<i>Svear</i>), and the
Danes (<i>Daner</i>) were the most prominent, though
several other names are mentioned, both by native
and foreign authors. The name Norseman, or
Northman, is not found among these, because it
refers not to any of the Aryan tribes, but is solely
derived from the country in which they settled.
Their country soon became known as Norway (Noregr
or Norvegr), <i>i. e.</i>, the Northern Way. It is the
long strip of territory extending north and south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
between the mountain chain Kj&ouml;len, which separates
it from Sweden and the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.
It looks on the map like a big bag slung across the
shoulders of Sweden.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful country&mdash;this land of the Norsemen.
The ocean roars along its rock-bound coast,
and during the long, dark winter the storms howl
and rage, and hurl the waves in white showers of
spray against the sky. Great swarms of sea-birds
drift like snow over the waters, and circle screaming
around the lonely cliffs. The aurora borealis flashes
like a huge shining fan over the northern heavens,
and the stars glitter with a keen frosty splendor.
But in the summer all this is changed, suddenly, as
by a miracle. Then the sun shines warmly, even
within the polar circle; innumerable wild flowers
sprout forth, the swelling rivers dance singing to the
sea, and the birches mingle their light-green foliage
with the darker needles of the pines. In the northern
districts it is light throughout the night, even
during the few hours while the sun dips beneath the
horizon; the ocean spreads like a great burnished
mirror under the cloudless sky, the fishes leap, and
the gulls and eider-ducks rock tranquilly upon the
shining waters. All along the coast there are excellent
harbors, which are free of ice both winter and
summer. A multitude of islands, some rocky and
barren, others covered with a scant growth of grass
and trees, afford hiding-places for ships and pasturage
for cattle. Moreover, long arms of the ocean&mdash;the
so-called fiords&mdash;penetrate far into the country,
and being filled with water from the gulf-stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which strikes the western coast of Norway, tend
greatly to moderate the climate. About the shores
of these fiords narrow strips of arable land stretch
themselves, with many interruptions, along the edge
of the water, and here the early Germanic settlers
built their houses and began their fight for existence.
Behind them and before them the great snow-hooded
mountains rose threateningly, sending down upon
them avalanches, floods, and sudden whirlwinds.
But, nothing daunted, they clung to the soil, explored
the land and the sea, and selected the most
favorable sites for their permanent dwellings.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">STONE AXES FROM THE LATER STONE AGE.</span>
</div>

<p>It is tolerably certain that the Aryan settlers in
Norway knew at that time very little of agriculture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but made their living by hunting, fishing, and cattle-raising.
The huts which they built of logs were
rude contrivances which could be easily torn down
and moved. But, as at a very early period, they
began to devote themselves more to the culture of
the ground, their dwellings were made larger, and
were built with greater care. When a horde of warriors
invaded a valley their first task was to clear
away the forests which grew dense and dark up over
the mountain sides. Their chieftain then built a <i>hov</i>
or temple for the gods, where sacrifices were made
at certain stated times. Whether it was the chieftain's
task to allot to each his share of land, or
whether each one chose according to his own preference,
is not known, but the former is the more
probable; for the Norsemen, proud and pugnacious
as they were, subordinated themselves, in historic
times, readily to their local chiefs, and accorded
them great honor. This sense of kinship within the
tribe and willing recognition of authority was the
more important in Norway, because the character of
the ground there compelled the people to live far
apart on scattered <i>gaards</i> or farms, between which
communication was often difficult. It would therefore
have been easy for the <i>b&ouml;nder</i> or peasants to
forget all public concerns and gradually to lapse into
isolation and savagery. But here their Germanic
nature, which had in it the germs of social progress,
asserted itself. As the centuries passed the people
were bound more strongly together by common pursuits
and common interests. First of all, their religious
observances brought them together, then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
necessity of defence against external enemies. Life
and property were in those days insecure possessions,
and it was only by acting in concert, under the leadership
of a valiant chief, that the scattered peasants
could hope to preserve either. Men had then fiercer
and more inflammable passions than they have now,
and only fear of retaliation could teach them self-restraint.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">STONE USED FOR SHAPING IMPLEMENTS.</span>
</div>

<p>It happened in this way that almost every separate
valley in Norway became a little kingdom by itself.
Such a diminutive kingdom was called a <i>fylki</i>. There
was not always a king, but a chief there was always,
and sometimes more than one. To the king belonged
the leadership in war. He was in some
district called a <i>jarl</i> or earl, though this name came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in later times to mean not an independent ruler, but
rather a land-grave, a royal governor. The king could
not tax the peasants for his support, nor impose any
burden upon them which they did not of their
own free choice accept. As a rule, his dignity was
inherited by his son, though the people were at
liberty, in case they disapproved of the heir, to
select another. This right was repeatedly exercised
in historic times, both in Sweden and Norway.
Sometimes, when the crops failed or bad weather
destroyed their herds, the peasants sacrificed their
king to their gods. All public misfortunes they
interpreted as a sign that the gods were angry, and
craved bloody atonement. If the crops were good
it was evident that their king was in favor with the
gods.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus036.jpg" width="500" height="135" alt="STONE KNIFE." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">STONE KNIFE.</span>
</div>

<p>It thus appears that the royal dignity among the
early Norsemen was burdened with unpleasant responsibilities.
It involved more duties than privileges,
for, besides commanding in war, the king had also
to conduct the public sacrifices at the great pagan
festivals. He was thus priest as well as king. In
fact, as before stated, he built the <i>hov</i> or temple
himself, and it was chiefly his ownership of this,
which raised him to a dignity superior to that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
other chieftains. It was by dint of this same authority
that he acted as judge at the <i>fylkis thing</i>, or
popular assembly, where all freeman met to consult
concerning public and private affairs. The <i>fylkis
thing</i> was neither a parliament nor a court of law,
but both combined. Private quarrels were settled,
blood-wites or fines agreed upon for homicides and
other injuries, and resolutions taken concerning peace
and war. It was not a representative assembly, the
members of which were elected by vote, but rather a
county meeting (<i>shiremote</i>) where every man who
could bear arms had a right to make himself heard.
You would scarcely wonder that where so many fierce
and turbulent warriors were gathered, breaches of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
peace were frequent. But when swords were drawn, it
was impossible to judge and deliberate. Therefore the
<i>fylkis thing</i> was hallowed, and to break the peace of
the <i>thing</i> was regarded
as the greatest of
crimes. If a man killed
another, and publicly
proclaimed himself his
slayer, the crime could
be atoned for by money
(blood-wite) paid to the
nearest surviving relative
of the dead man.
If the relatives accepted
the blood-wite, they
were not at liberty to
seek revenge. But in
ancient times it was regarded
as more honorable
to refuse the money
and resort to the sword.
If a man slew another
secretly and denied the
crime he was held to
be a murderer, and
could not offer blood-wite.
He was then
outlawed, and every
man who saw him
was at liberty to slay
him.</p>

<span class="caption">ROCK PICTURE OF A SHIP AT

</div>

<p>Such were the Norsemen during the first centuries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
after their settlement in their present home. In
spite of their violence and proneness to bloodshed,
you will yet admit that they had many traits which
were admirable. They could recognize authority,
and yet preserve their sturdy sense of independence.
Simple and imperfect as their <i>fylkis things</i> were,
they suffice to show an aptitude for self-government,
and a recognition of the people itself, as the source
of authority. These tall blonde men with their defiant
blue eyes, who obeyed their kings while they had
confidence in them, and killed them when they had
forfeited their respect, were the ancestors of the
Normans who under William the Conqueror invaded
England, and founded the only European
state which has since reached the highest civilization
and the highest liberty, through slow and even stages
of orderly development.</p>

<h3>THE RELIGION OF THE NORSEMEN.</h3>


<p>The Icelander Snorre Sturlasson wrote in the
thirteenth century a very remarkable book, called
the Heimskringla, or the Sagas of the Kings of Norway.
In this book he says that Odin, the highest
god of the Norsemen, was the chief who first led the
Germanic tribes into Europe. He was a great warrior
and was always victorious. Therefore, when he
was dead, the people made sacrifices to him and
prayed to him for victory. They did not believe,
however, that he was actually dead, but that he had
returned to his old home in Asia, whence he still
watched their fortunes and occasionally visited them
in person. Many tales are told in the sagas of people
who had seen Odin, particularly when a great
battle was to be fought. He was represented as a
tall, bearded man with one eye, and clad as a warrior.
He had two brothers, Vile and Ve, and many
sons and daughters who were worshipped like him
and became gods and goddesses. Odin and his children
were called <i>Aesir</i>, which Snorre says means
Asia-men; and their home <i>Asgard</i>, or <i>Asaheim</i>, likewise
indicates their Asiatic origin. During their migrations
the <i>Aesir</i> came in contact with another peo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>ple,
called the <i>Vanir</i>, with whom, after an indecisive
battle, they formed an alliance. The <i>Vanir</i> then made
common cause with the <i>Aesir</i> and were worshipped
like them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">BRONZE SWORD. (Vesterg&ouml;tland in Sweden.)</span>
</div>

<p>Whether there is any basis of truth in this tradition,
is difficult to determine. We know that primitive
nations usually make gods of their early kings
and chieftains, and worship them after death. Every
year that passes makes them look greater and more
mysterious. In storms and earthquakes, in thunder
and lightning, they hear their voices and see the
manifestations of their power. More and more they
become identified with the elements which they are
supposed to rule; the mighty attributes of the sun,
the sky, and the sea are given to them, and to each
is allotted his particular sphere of action. The chieftain
who has been a valiant warrior in his life-time is
supposed to give victory to those who call upon
him. He who has excelled in the arts of peace continues
to rule over the seasons, and to give good
crops and prosperity to those who, by sacrifices,
secure his good-will. This may have been the origin
of the Scandinavian gods; although many scholars
maintain that they were from the beginning personifications
of the elements, and have never had an
actual existence on earth. But whether they were
originally men or sun-myths, interesting legends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>have been told about them which may be worth
recounting.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span></p>

<br />
<span class="caption">LOOR OR WAR HORN OF BRONZE. (Skaane.)</span>
</div>

<p>In the beginning of time there were two worlds,
Muspelheim, the world of fire, whose king was
Surtur, and Niflheim, the world of frost and darkness.
In Niflheim was the spring Hvergelmer, where
dwelt the terrible dragon Nidh&ouml;gger. Between
these two worlds was the yawning chasm Ginnungagap.
The spring Hvergelmer sent forth twelve icy
rivers, which were called the Elivagar. These
gradually filled up the chasm Ginnungagap. As the
wild waters rushed into the abyss, they froze and were
again thawed by the sparks that were blown from
the fiery Muspelheim. The frozen vapors fell as
hoar-frost, and the heat imparted life to them.
They took shape and fashioned themselves into the
Yotun or giant Ymer, from whom descends the evil
race of frost-giants. Simultaneously with Ymer the
cow Audhumbla came into being. She licked the
briny hoar-frost, and a mighty being appeared with
the shape of a man. He was large and beautiful, and
was named Bure. His son was B&ouml;r, who married
the daughter of a Yotun, and got three sons, Odin,
Vile, and Ve. These three brothers slew the Yotun
Ymer, and in his blood all the race of Yotuns was
drowned except one couple, from whom a new race
of giants descended. Then Odin and his brothers
dragged the huge body of Ymer into the middle of
Ginnungagap, and fashioned from it the world. Out
of the flesh they made the earth, the bones became
stones and lofty mountains, and his blood the sea.
From his hair they made the trees, and from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
skull the great vault of the sky. His brain they
scattered in the air, where its fragments
yet float about in queer, fantastic shapes,
and are called clouds. The flying sparks
from Muspelheim they gathered up and
fashioned them into sun, moon, and stars,
which they flung up against the blue vault
of the sky. Then they arranged land and
water so that the ocean flowed round about
the entire earth, and beyond the watery
waste they fixed the abode of the Yotuns.
This cold and barren realm beyond the sea
is therefore called Utgard or Yotunheim.
From the earth to the sky they suspended
a bridge of many colors, which they named
Bifrost or the rainbow. The Yotun woman
Night married Delling (the Dawn) and
became the mother of Day, who rode in
his shining chariot across the sky, always
followed by his dark mother. The latter
drove a huge black horse named Hrimfaxe,
from whose foamy bit dropped the
dew that refreshed the grass during the
hours of darkness, while Day's horse,
Skinfaxe, spread from his radiant mane the
glorious light over the earth. It is further
told that the heat bred in Ymer's body a
multitude of maggots, which assumed the
shapes of tiny men and were called
gnomes or dwarves. They live in caves and
mountains, and know of all the treasures of
gold and silver and precious stones in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
secret chambers of the rocks. They also have great
skill in the working of metals, but they cannot endure
the light of the sun. Last of all man was created. One
day when the three gods, Odin, H&ouml;ner, and Lodur
were walking on the shores of the sea they found two
trees, and from these they made a man and a woman,
named Ask and Embla (ash and elm). Odin gave
them the breath of life, H&ouml;ner, speech and reason,
Lodur, blood and fair complexions.</p>

<p>The old Norsemen conceived of the world as an
enormous ash tree, named Ygdrasil, the three roots
of which extend, one to the gods in Asgard, another
to Yotunheim, the third to Niflheim. On the third
gnaws continually the dragon Nidh&ouml;gger. In the
top of the tree sits an eagle; among the branches
four stags are running; and up and down on the
trunk frisks a squirrel who carries slander and endeavors
to make mischief between the eagle and the
dragon. Under the root which stretches to Yotunheim
is the fountain of the wise Yotun Mimer, to
whom Odin gave one of his eyes in return for a
draught from his fountain. For whoever drank from
its water became instantly wise. Under the second
root of the ash, which draws its nourishment
from heaven, is the sacred fountain of Urd, whither
the gods ride daily over the bridge Bifrost. Here
they meet the three Norns&mdash;Urd, Verdande, and
Skuld (Past, Present, and Future), the august goddesses
of Fate, whose decrees not even the gods are
able to change. The Norns pour the water of the
fountain over Ygdrasil's root, and thereby keep the
world-tree alive. They govern the fates of gods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and men, giving life or death to whomever they
please.</p>

<p>Odin dwells with all the other gods in Asgard,
where he receives in his shining hall Valhalla all
those who have died by the sword. He is therefore
called Valfather, and those fallen warriors whom he
chooses to be his guests, are known as <i>einheriar</i>,
<i>i. e.</i>, great champions. Valhalla is splendidly decorated
with burnished weapons. The ceiling is made
of spears, the roof is covered with shining shields,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and the walls are adorned with armor and coats
of mail. Hence the champions issue forth every
day and fight great battles, killing and maiming
each other. But every night they wake up
whole and unscathed and return to Odin's hall,
where they spend the night in merry carousing.
The maidens of Odin&mdash;the Valkyries, who, before
every battle, select those who are to be slain, wait
upon the warriors, fill their great horns with mead,
and give them the flesh of swine to eat.</p>

<p>The great gathering-place of the gods in Asgard
is the plains of Ida. Here is Odin's throne, where
he sits looking out over the whole world. At his
side sit the two wolves&mdash;Gere and Freke, and on
his shoulders the ravens, Hugin and Munin, who
daily fly forth and bear him tidings from the remotest
regions of the earth. If he wishes to travel,
he mounts his eight-footed horse Sleipner, which carries
him far and wide with wonderful speed. When
the father of gods and men rides to battle he wears a
helmet of gold and a suit of mail, which shines dazzlingly
from afar. He carries also his spear Gungner,
which he sends forth whenever he wishes to
arouse men to warfare and strife. But, besides being
the god of war, Odin also delights in poetry and
sage counsel. He is the god of the scalds or poets;
for he had drunk of Suttung's mead, which imparted
the gift of song. He is well skilled in sorcery, and
has taught men the art of writing runes.</p>

<p>Thor, the son of Odin, lives in Thrudvang. He
is the strongest of all the gods, and has an enormous
hammer, Mjolner, with which he carries on a cease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>less
warfare against the Yotuns, or mist-giants. He
rides in a cart drawn by two rams across the Gjallar
bridge (the resounding bridge), which leads to Yotunheim,
and the rattling of the cart and the noise
of his hammer, as he hurls it at the heads of the
fleeing giants, make the vault of the sky tremble.
This is what men call thunder. When Thor is hungry,
he kills his rams and eats their flesh, but he is
always careful to gather up the bones and to throw
them back into the skins. Then, the next morning,
the rams are as frisky as ever and ready for service.
Thor has a wife named Sif, whose hair is of
gold.</p>

<p>Balder, the good and the beautiful, is also the son
of Odin. He is wise and gentle, and kindness beams
from his countenance. His wife is Nanna, and his
dwelling Breidablik.</p>

<p>Njord is ruler of the sea, and can raise storms and
calm the waves at his pleasure. He is of the race of
the Vanir, but is yet worshipped as a god. He is the
owner of great wealth, and can give prosperity to
those who obtain his favor. Njord was married to
the Yotun woman, Skade, but was again separated
from her. His abode is at Noatun, from which
he has wide view of the sea.</p>

<p>Frey, the son of Njord, rules over the seasons, and
gives peace and good crops. Fields and pastures grow,
and the cattle thrive in the sunshine of his favor.
He lives with his wife Gerd in Alfheim. Tyr is
the god of courage, whom men call upon as they are
about to go into battle. He has but one hand,
having thrust the other into the mouth of the Fenris-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Wolf,
who bit it off. Brage is the god of song,
and of vows and pledges. He has a long beard, and,
is possessed of wisdom and eloquence. When men
drained the horn in his honor, they made vows of
daring deeds which they would perform, and called
the god to witness that they would keep them.
Many were those who, while drunk, pledged themselves
to foolhardy undertakings, and perished in
the attempt to carry them out. Brage's wife is the
ever-young Idun. She has in her keeping the wonderful
apples, which the gods eat to preserve the
beauty and vigor of an eternal youth.</p>

<p>The watchman of the gods is named Heimdal.
His senses are so keen that nothing can escape him.
He can see hundreds of miles, and he can hear the
grass grow. When he blows his Gjallar horn (the
resounding horn), its rousing call is heard throughout
the world. Heimdal's dwelling is Himinbjarg at
the Bifrost Bridge.</p>

<p>Among gods of less consequence may be mentioned
Uller, the step-son of Thor, who is a master
in running on snow-shoes; Forsete, the son of Balder,
who makes peace between those who have quarrelled;
H&ouml;der, the blind god, who shot Balder; and the silent
Vidar.</p>

<p>Foremost among the goddesses is Frigg, the wife
of Odin, who dwells in Fensal. She shields from
danger those who call upon her. Freya, the Northern
Venus, is the goddess of beauty. She is the daughter
of Njord, and was forsaken by her husband Odd, and
is ever hoping for his return. She travelled far and
wide in search of him, and wept because she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
not find him. Her tears turned into gold, and gold
is therefore by the poets called the tears of Freya.
Her chariot, in which she drives over the sky, is
drawn by cats, though at times she flies in the guise
of a swan and visits distant lands. Her necklace,
Brising, made by wonder-working gnomes, is of dazzling
splendor. The dwelling of Freya is Folkvang,
and thither ascend the prayers of lovelorn swains and
maidens. Freya's daughter, Hnos, is of marvellous
beauty and a sweet disposition. Her name is still
used in the nursery as a pet-name for babes.</p>

<p>The dominion of the sea does not belong entirely
to Njord. The Yotun Aeger rules over the towering
waves, and lashes them into fury, until Njord
again curbs them and bids them be still. Yet
Aeger is the friend of the gods, and is at times visited
by them in his magnificent submarine hall, where
ale and mead flow abundantly. He is himself peaceably
disposed toward men, but is overruled by his
terrible wife Ran, who with her nine daughters (the
waves) causes shipwrecks and draws the drowned
men down to her watery abode.</p>

<p>One dweller in Asgard is still to be mentioned, and
that is the evil Loke, who disturbs the peace of the
gods, and will work their final ruin. He was born
among the Yotuns, but gained the confidence of
Odin by his agreeable presence and his fair speech.
He delighted in mischief and loved evil-doing. He
had three terrible children&mdash;the wolf Fenris, the
world-serpent, and Hel. As these monsters grew up,
the gods foresaw that their presence in Asgard
would cause trouble. The wolf Fenris was, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
after having broken the strongest chains, tied with a
magical cord, made of the noise of cats'-paws, women's
beard, roots of mountains, and other equally intangible
things. This cord he could not break.
The world-serpent was thrown into the ocean, where
it continued to grow until it encircled all the earth
and at last bit its own tail. Hel was banished to
Helheim, where she became the ruler of the dead, and
the goddess of the under-world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE AGE OF THE VIKINGS. THE ORIGIN OF THE
VIKING CRUISES.</h3>


<p>The Norsemen had up to the middle of the eighth
century played no part in the world's history. Their
very existence had been unknown or but vaguely
known to the rest of Europe. But towards the close
of the eighth century they broke like a destructive
tempest over the civilized lands, spreading desolation
in their path. When their fast-sailing ships with two
square sails were sighted at the river-mouths, people
fled in terror, and the priests prayed in vain: "Deliver
us, O Lord, from the rage of the Norsemen."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

NEAR SANDEFJORD." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">THE VIKING SHIP RECENTLY UNEARTHED AT GOGSTAD,
NEAR SANDEFJORD.</span>
</div>

<p>There were several reasons for this sudden warlike
activity on the part of the Norsemen. They had
waged war from immemorial times; because war was
with them the most honorable occupation. As Tacitus
says of their kinsmen, the Germans: "They
deemed it a disgrace to acquire by sweat what
they might obtain by blood." But previous to the
viking period they had fought each other. One earl
or king made foraging expeditions into the land of
his neighbors, and carried away with him whatever
booty he could lay hands on. But in this perpetual
warfare one or the other must at length become ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>hausted,
and the stronger would be likely to oust or
vanquish the weaker. This was what happened in
the north. Large tracts of land, made up of small
conquered kingdoms, were united under one successful
chief, who, of course, made haste to prevent
depredations within his own boundaries. With the
growing power of these local kings, it became more
and more risky to attack them, and the field for domestic
warfare thus became constantly narrower.
But war was the very condition of the chieftain's
existence among the early Norsemen. His honor
was dependent upon the number of his followers
and the splendor of their equipments, and to gain
the means to entertain and to equip them he was
obliged to wage war. When he could no longer do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
it at home, he naturally went abroad. It was neither
ferocity nor excessive avarice which impelled him to
draw the sword; but the desire to preserve his honor
among men, which, in a warlike state, is merely another
form of the instinct of self-preservation. The
high-born chieftain had to make himself formidable
in order to protect his life and property. He had to
live in accordance with his rank, if he wished to live
at all. His men-at-arms were his body-guard as well
as his army. He had to behave royally toward them
in order to preserve their good-will; and next to personal
valor, liberality in giving was the first duty of a
king. The king is therefore called the breaker of
rings (large solid arm-rings of gold being used for
purposes of payment) and the hater of gold.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Munch (Det Norske Folk's Historie, 1-124) derives the word
king (old Norse, konungr; Anglo-Saxon, cyning; O. H. German,
chuninc and chunig) from Kun or Kon, meaning race, descent; and
interprets the word as meaning (like Lat., generosus) of high birth or
descent.</p></div>

<p>There is in the earliest Germanic times no sharp
distinction between the titles "earl" and "king."
The viking cruises, however, helped to establish a
distinction. The earl who, having gathered a large
number of warriors about him, went abroad for purposes
of conquest, was hailed by his men as king. A
number of vikings, of high birth, assumed the name
of kings, when starting on warlike expeditions; but
were known as sea-kings, in contra-distinction to
those who ruled at home over a fixed domain. The
number of these sea-kings increased (for the reasons
cited above) enormously toward the close of the
eighth century. They harried not only the coasts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>of the neighboring lands, but they crossed the North
Sea and the Baltic, carrying away or slaughtering the
inhabitants and destroying the cities. Churches and
monasteries they plundered, scattering the bones of
the saints to the four winds; all that Christian men
held sacred they trod under foot. And yet we must
bear in mind that all we know about these early
vikings is derived from the writings of their enemies,
who were smarting under the injury they had done
them. That they were fierce and brutal is credible
enough. The warlike state is in itself brutalizing.
It arouses all the slumbering savagery in man, and
smothers his gentler impulses. But certain moral
qualities even their hostile chroniclers concede to
them. They admit that the Norse barbarians were,
as a rule, faithful to their oaths and kept their
promises.</p>

<p>Three periods<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> are recognizable in the viking age,
though there are, in point of time, no sharp divisions
between them. It would, perhaps, be more correct
to say that there were three kinds of vikings. The
first cruises were more or less tentative and irregular.
Chieftains gather about them crews for a few ships
and sail over to England, Denmark, or Flanders,
where they attack a city or a monastery, and return
home with their booty. The second period shows
an advance in the art of war and in military experience.
Several vikings attack in company some exposed
point, take possession of it, erect fortifications,
and make forays into the surrounding country.
During the third period the Norsemen abandon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
their character of pirates and assume the r&ocirc;le of
conquerors. With large fleets, counting from one
to five hundred ships, they storm and sack cities,
assume the government of the conquered territories,
treat, as regular belligerents, with kings and emperors,
and establish themselves permanently in the
conquered land. Of the two first classes of vikings
we have only scattered and unreliable accounts. To
go on viking cruises is a recognized occupation in the
Norse sagas, and it was regarded as a kind of liberal
education for a young man of good birth to spend
some years of his youth on such expeditions. His
honor was thereby greatly increased at home, and
his position in society assured. Royal youths of
twelve or fifteen years often went abroad as commanders
of viking fleets, in order to test their manhood
and accumulate experience and knowledge of
men.</p>

</div>

<p>The third class of vikings, the conquerors, have
found their historians both at home and abroad; and
the different narratives, though not strictly accurate,
supplement and correct each other. It is these conquering
vikings who have demonstrated the historic
mission of Norway, and doubly indemnified the world
for the misery they brought upon it. The ability
to endure discipline without loss of self-respect,
voluntary subordination for mutual benefit, and
the power of orderly organization, based upon these
qualities, these were the contributions of the Norse
vikings to the political life of Europe. The feudal
state, which, with all its defects, is yet the indispensable
basis of a higher civilization, has its root in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Germanic instinct of loyalty&mdash;of mutual allegiance
between master and vassal; and the noble spirit of
independence which restrains and limits the power
of the ruler, and at a later stage leads to constitutional
government, is even a more distinctly Norse than
Germanic characteristic. While Norway, up under
the pole, has developed a democracy, Germany,
coming at too early a period into contact with
Rome, has developed a military despotism under
constitutional forms. The breath of new life which
the vikings infused into history lives to-day in Norway,
in England, and in America.</p>

<p>Among the earliest conquests of the Norse vikings
was a portion of the present Sleswick which
after them was called Nortmannia. It is possible
that they recognized the sovereignty of the kings of
Denmark, though there is no direct evidence that
they regarded themselves as vassals. The first intelligence
we obtain concerning them is that their
king Sigfrid, in the year 777, received hospitably the
Saxon chieftain Widukind, who, when summoned to
meet Charlemagne in Paderborn, fled northward and
sought refuge with his Norse co-religionists. This
Sigfrid belonged to the renowned race of the Ynglings,
from whom descended Harold the Fairhaired,
and through him a long line of Norwegian kings. A
later king of Nortmannia, who also had great possessions
in Norway, was Gudr&ouml;d or Godfrey the
Hunter. He came, through the friendship of the
Saxons, repeatedly into collision with Charlemagne,
and even threatened to attack the emperor in Aachen.
It is told that he was killed by his own men in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
year 809. He had about a year before attacked and
slain the king of Agder, whose daughter Aasa he married.
She bore him a son named Halfdan the
Swarthy, but avenged her father's death by inducing
her servant to kill her husband while he was drunk.
One of Godfrey's sons, Erik, carried on an intermittent
warfare with Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious,
sent embassies to Aachen, and in 845, during the
reign of Louis the German, sacked and burned the
city of Hamburg. St. Ansgarius, the apostle of the
North, who had been established by the emperor as
archbishop of Hamburg, fled with all his priests;
and the church and the monastery which he had
founded were utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>It was not only in his remote northern domains that
Charlemagne came in contact with the vikings. The
chronicles of the Monks of St. Gall relate that he also
encountered them in his Mediterranean provinces.
Once, as he was visiting a city in Gallia Narbonensis,
some fast-sailing Norse ships with square sails were
seen out in the harbor. Soon a message was brought
to the emperor that the crews had landed and were
plundering the shore. Nobody then knew to what
nationality these ships belonged, some conjecturing
that they were Jewish, others African, and again
others that they were British merchant vessels.</p>

<p>"No," said Charlemagne, "these ships are not
filled with merchandise, but with the most pugnacious
foes."</p>

<p>Hearing this everybody seized his weapons and
hastened to the harbor; but the vikings had in the
meanwhile learned that the emperor was in the city,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and as they were not strong enough to fight with
him, they fled to sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">ST. ANSGARIUS, THE APOSTLE OF THE NORTH.</span>
</div>

<p>It is related that Charlemagne, as he stood at his
window and watched their flight, wept. Remarking
the wonder of his men, he said:</p>

<p>"I do not weep because I fear that these miscreants
can do me any harm; but I am grieved that,
while I am alive, they have dared to show themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
upon this coast; and I foresee with dread all the evil
they will do to my descendants."<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Munch (Det. Norske Folks Historie 1-414) questions the credibility
of this story, because the Norsemen did not show themselves in
the Mediterranean as early as the chronicle here indicates; in fact
not before 800 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p></div>

<p>This story, endowing the emperor with prophetic
vision, has a certain legendary flavor, and may be a
monkish invention. Similar prophecies, dating after
the event, are found in other ecclesiastical authors,
and show sufficiently the feeling with which
the Norsemen were regarded. It is especially one
typical viking, the renowned Hasting, who figures
both in sacred and profane chronicles. He sailed
up the Loire in 841, with a large fleet, burned
the city of Amboise, and besieged Tours. The inhabitants,
however, carried the bones of their patron
saint up on the walls; and, according to the story, by
the intervention of the saint, the vikings were put
to flight. In 845, Hasting is reported to have attacked
Paris, in company with Bj&ouml;rn Ironside, the
son of Ragnar Lodbrok. To the Baltic and even to
the shore of the Mediterranean this fearless marauder
extended his ravages, and as success attended
his banner, he grew more daring and determined to
lay siege to Rome.</p>

<p>He even aspired to put the imperial crown upon
his brow. With as large a fleet as he could muster
he sailed through the Pillars of Hercules, but before
he reached the mouth of the Tiber, a storm drove
his ships to the city of Luna, near Carrara. Being
poorly versed in geography, Hasting mistook this
city for Rome, and resolved to capture it by strategem.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">IRON IMPLEMENT OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE; USE UNKNOWN.</span>
</div>

<p>He sent word to the bishop that he was
very ill and desired to be baptized, so that he
might die a Christian. The bishop, as well as
the commander of the town, fell into the trap.
Delighted at the prospect of gaining so valuable
a convert, they opened the gates and invited
the Norsemen to enter. These, in the meanwhile,
declared, that since sending his message,
Hasting had died; and with great pomp they
bore his coffin, followed by a funeral procession
of enormous length, into the cathedral where
the bishop stood ready to read the mass for the
repose of the viking's soul. Suddenly, however,
as the coffin was deposited before the altar and
the mass commenced, Hasting sprang up, flung
away his shroud, and stood in flashing armor before
the astonished populace. His men, at this signal,
also flung off their mourning cloaks and drew their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
swords. The bishop and his priests were killed, and
blood flowed in torrents through the sacred aisles.
A terrible carnage ensued, and the city was captured.
Having accomplished this enterprise, Hasting discovered
that, while deceiving, he had himself been
deceived. It was not Rome he had taken after all.
Whether he accepted this as an omen or not, he lost
his desire to make his entry into the eternal city.
Content with the booty he had accumulated, he
turned his prows toward France where he became the
vassal of Charles the Bald, from whom he received
valuable fiefs.<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_4" id="Footnote_A_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_4"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The Norse Sagas make no mention of Hasting, and Munch (1-429)
gives several reasons for questioning whether he was an historical
character.</p></div>

<p>Many other vikings are mentioned in chronicles
of later date, who by their incessant attacks upon the
coasts, taxed the energy of the weak Carolingian
kings to the utmost. One of them, named Ragnar,
is said to have plundered Paris in 845, and another,
named Asgeir, had four years earlier sacked and
burned Rouen and the monastery Jumi&egrave;ges. He
spent eleven years ravaging the coasts of France, and
finally, in 851, sailed up the Seine, destroyed the
monastery Fontenelle and burned Beauvois. On
his return to the sea he was defeated by the French,
and had to hide with his men in the woods, but succeeded
in recapturing his ships and making good his
escape. Of a third one, R&ouml;rek, it is told that about
the year 862 he accepted Christianity, without, as it
appears, experiencing any perceptible change of
heart. After having ravaged Dorestad and Nimwegen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>two flourishing cities on the Rhine, and
having defended himself heroically against King Lothair,
the younger, he made peace (873) with Louis
the German, and refrained from further depredations.</p>

<p>There is a certain uniformity in the deeds of the
vikings, whether they be Norsemen or Danes, which
makes further description superfluous. Only a few
of their more daring enterprises may be briefly
alluded to.</p>

<p>To Ireland the Norsemen had been attracted at a
comparatively early period. In the last decade of
the eighth century they destroyed the monastery of
Iona or Icolmkill, and between the years 810 and
830 they spread terror and devastation along the
entire coast. In the year 838 they sailed with one
hundred and twenty ships up to Dublin and conquered
the city, under the leadership of Thorgisl,
who still lives in Irish song and story under the
names of Turges and Turgesius.</p>

<p>"After many sharp fights," says an old author,<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
"he conquered in a short time all Ireland, and
erected, wherever he went, high fortifications of
masonry with deep moats, of which many ruins are
yet to be seen in the country." At last he fell in
love with the daughter of Maelsechnail, king in
Meath, and demanded of him that he should send
her to him, attended by fifteen young maidens.
Thorgisl promised to meet her with the same number
of high-born Norsemen on an island in Loch
Erne. But instead of maidens Maelsechnail sent
fifteen beardless young men, disguised as women and
armed with daggers. When Thorgisl arrived he was
attacked by these and slain. On a previous occasion
Maelsechnail had asked Thorgisl what he should do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>to get rid of some strange and injurious birds that
had got into the country. "Destroy their nests,"
said Thorgisl. Accordingly Maelsechnail began at
once to destroy the Norse castles, while the Irish
slew or chased away the Norsemen.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_5" id="Footnote_A_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_5"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Giraldus Cambrensis, <i>De Topogr. Hiberni&aelig;</i>, cap. 37. Quoted

<p>It appears probable that Thorgisl's reign in Ireland
lasted from 838 to 846, although a much longer
period is given by the above-quoted chronicler. A
more enduring sway over the country was gained by
the Norse sea-king Olaf the White, who belonged to
the great Yngling race. In 852 a company of Danish
vikings had possession of Dublin; but Olaf defeated
them and compelled them to send him hostages.
He then established himself in the city,
built castles, and taxed the surrounding country.
Two other Norsemen, the brothers Sigtrygg and
Ivar, founded about the same time kingdoms&mdash;the
former in Waterford, the latter in Limerick&mdash;without,
however, being able to compete with Olaf in
splendor and power. The dominion of the Norsemen
in Dublin is said to have lasted for three hundred
and fifty years. From Irish sources a somewhat
different account is derived of these remarkable
events. It is told that the Norsemen often sailed
up the rivers, not as warriors, but as peaceful merchants,
and that the Irish found it advantageous to
trade with them. They thus gained considerable
possessions in the cities, and when the vikings came
there was already a party in the larger cities who
favored them and made their conquests easy.</p>

<p>From Dublin Olaf the White made two cruises to
Scotland, laid siege to Dumbarton, sailed southward
to England, plundering and ravaging, and returned
to Dublin with two hundred ships laden with precious
booty. The Orkneys, the Hebrides, and the
Faroe Isles were also, during this period, repeatedly
visited by the vikings, and even to Iceland expedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>tions
were made, which did not, however, result in
permanent settlement. The Irish hermits and pious
monks, who had retired from the world into the
Arctic solitude, were disturbed in their devotions
by the unwelcome visitors, and the majority returned
to Ireland, while some are said to have
remained until the island was regularly settled by
the Norsemen.</p>

<p>To England the Norsemen went for the first time
with hostile intent in 787. During the reign of
King Beorthric in Wessex a small flock of vikings
landed in the neighborhood of Dorchester, killed some
people, and were driven away again. The Anglo-Saxon
chronicle<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> relates the incident in these words:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_6" id="Footnote_A_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_6"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> <i>Monum. Hist. Brit.</i>, pp. 336, 337. Quoted from Munch, i., 416.</p></div>

<p>"In this year (787) King Beorthric married Eadburg,
daughter of King Offa. In those days came
for the first time Northmen and ships from Heredhaland.
The <i>ger&ecirc;fa</i> (commander) rode down to
them and wished to drive them to the king's dwelling.
For he knew not who they were; but they
slew him there. These were the first ships belonging
to Danish men which visited England."</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the ships are said in the same
breath to have belonged to Northmen and to Danes,
and it is obvious that the chronicler supposes the
terms to be synonymous. The Heredhaland from
which the men came was in all probability Hardeland
in Jutland, where the Norsemen had at that
time a colony.</p>

<p>The next attack of which we have an account was
directed against the coast of Northumberland, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>took place in the year 794. The monk Simeon of
Durham,<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who lived in the beginning of the twelfth
century, writes as follows:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_7" id="Footnote_A_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_7"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Simeon of Durham, <i>Monum. Hist. Brit.</i>, p. 668. Quoted from
Munch, i., 417.</p></div>

<p>"The heathen came from the northern countries
to Britain like stinging wasps, roamed about like
savage wolves, robbing, biting, killing not only
horses, sheep, and cattle, but also priests, acolytes,
monks, and nuns. They went to Lindisfarena
church, destroying every thing in the most miserable
manner, and trod the sanctuary with their profane
feet, threw down the altars, robbed the treasures of
the church, killed some of the brothers, carried
others away in captivity, mocked many and flung
them away naked, and threw some into the ocean.
In 794 they harried King Ecgfridh's harbor, and
plundered the monastery of Donmouth. But St. Cuthbert
did not permit them to escape unpunished; for
their chieftain was visited with a cruel death by the
English and, a short time after, their ships were
destroyed by a storm, and many of them perished;
a few who swam ashore were killed without pity."</p>

<p>It is an odd circumstance that while an incessant
stream of Norse vikings, during the first half of
the ninth century, poured southward, devastating
the shores of the Baltic and the Mediterranean,
only a comparatively small number found
their way to England. We hear in the Sagas of
many individual warriors who visited the Saxon
kings in England and took service under them, and
of several who sailed up the Thames and put an embargo
on the trade of the river, capturing every ship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>that ventured into their clutches. But as a field for
conquest they left England (probably not from any
fraternal consideration) to their kinsmen, the Danes,
while they themselves turned their attention to
France, Ireland, and the isles north of Scotland. In
the Hebrides, the Orkneys, the Shetland Islands, and
the Faeroe Isles, their descendants are still living,
and Norse names are yet frequent.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">RUIN OF NORSE TOWER AT MOS&Ouml;, SHETLAND ISLANDS.</span>
</div>

<p>Another notable circumstance in connection with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the vikings is, that the very men whom foreign
chroniclers describe as stinging wasps and savage
wolves, and of whom the greatest atrocities are related
during their sojourn abroad, became, as a rule,
after their return home, men of weight and influence,
with respect for tradition and law&mdash;men who, according
to the standard of the time, were moral and honorable.
There were exceptions, of course, but they
go to prove the rule. The explanation is not far to
seek. Religion in those days was tribal, and morality
had no application outside the tribe. Every people
is the chosen people of its own god or gods. As the
Jews divided humanity into Jews and Gentiles, and
the Greeks into Greeks and barbarians, so the Norsemen
retaliated towards Jews and Greeks, by including
them with all other nations in the Norse equivalent
for barbarians. English, Irish, and Germans, often
men of high birth, were constantly brought to Norway
by the vikings as thralls, bartered and sold and
forced to menial tasks. No law extended its protection
to them; and yet maltreatment of thralls
was, both in Iceland and Norway, regarded as unworthy
of a freeman. For all that, the vikings
were children of their age, and practised only the
rude morality which their religion prescribed. The
humanitarian sentiment which regards all men as
brethren and creatures of the same God is a comparatively
modern growth, and it would be unfair to
judge the old Norsemen by any such advanced
standard. It is therefore quite credible that the
vikings may have been guilty of deeds abroad
which they would not have committed at home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>HALFDAN THE SWARTHY.</h3>


<p>The Yngling race traced its ancestry from the god
Frey. Snorre Sturlasson, in his famous work, "The
Sagas of the Kings of Norway,"<a name="FNanchor_A_8" id="FNanchor_A_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_8" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> mentions a long
line of kings who were descended from Fj&ouml;lne, a son
of Frey, and reigned in Sweden having their residence
in Upsala. Yngve was one of the god's surnames, and
Yngling means a descendant of Yngve. One of the
Ynglings, named Aun the Old, sacrificed every ten
years one of his sons to Odin, having been promised
that for every son he sacrificed, ten years
should be added to his life. When he had thus
slain seven sons, and was so old that he had to be fed
like an infant, his people grew weary of him and saved
the eighth son, whom he was about to sacrifice.
Ingjald Ill-Ruler, when he took the kingdom on the
death of his father Anund, sixth in descent from
Aun the Old, made a great funeral feast, to which he
invited all the neighboring kings. When he rose to
drink the Brage goblet,<a name="FNanchor_B_9" id="FNanchor_B_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_9" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> he vowed that he would increase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his kingdom by one half toward all the four
corners of the heavens, or die in the attempt. As a
preliminary step he set fire to the hall, burned his
guests, and took possession of their lands. When he
died, about the middle of the seventh century, he
was so detested by his people that they would not
accept his son, nor any of his race, as his successor.
The son, whose name was Olaf, therefore gathered
about him as many as would follow him, and emigrated
to the great northern forests, where he felled
the trees, gained much arable lands, and thereby
acquired the nickname The Wood-cutter.<a name="FNanchor_C_10" id="FNanchor_C_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_10" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> He and
his people became prosperous, and a great influx of
the discontented from the neighboring lands followed.
In fact, so great was the number of immigrants that
the country could not feed them, and they were
threatened with famine. This they attributed, however,
to the fact that Olaf was not in the favor of
the gods, and they sacrificed him to Odin.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_8" id="Footnote_A_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_8"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> "The Heimskringla, or the Sagas of the Kings of Norway," by

and continued by his nephew Sturla Thordsson, is the principal source
of the history of Norway up to the middle of the thirteenth century.</p></div>

<p>His son, Halfdan Whiteleg,<a name="FNanchor_A_11" id="FNanchor_A_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_11" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> was a great warrior.
He conquered Raumarike in Norway and the great
and fertile district called Vestfold, west of the fjord
called Folden (now the Christiania Fjord). Here
he founded a famous temple in Skiringssal, which
soon became a flourishing trading station and a
favorite residence of the Norwegian kings. The
third in descent from him was the great viking
Godfrey the Hunter, who waged war against Charlemagne,
and Godfrey's son was Halfdan the
Swarthy.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_11" id="Footnote_A_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_11"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Hvitbein.</p></div>

<p>Halfdan was but a year old in 810 when his father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was killed. At the age of eighteen, he assumed the
government of Agder, which he inherited from his
maternal grandfather. By warfare and by marriage
he also increased the great possessions he had received
from his father, and, was, beyond dispute,
the mightiest king in all Norway. It is told of him
that he was a man of great intelligence, who loved
justice and truth. He gave laws which he himself
kept and compelled every one else to keep. In order
that no one should with impunity tread the law
under foot, he fixed a scale of fines which offenders
should pay in accordance with their birth and dignity.
This code was the so-called Eidsiva-Law,
which had great influence in politically uniting the
southern districts of Norway which Halfdan had
gathered under his sway.</p>

<p>About King Halfdan's second marriage a story is
told, which, whether originally true or not, has obviously
been the subject of legendary adornment.
It runs as follows:</p>

<p>There was a king in Ringerike whose name was
Sigurd Hjort. He was a large and strong man. He
had a daughter named Ragnhild, who was very
beautiful, and a son named Guttorm. While Sigurd
Hjort was out hunting he was attacked by the
<i>berserk</i><a name="FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Hake and thirty men. He fought desperately,
and slew twelve of his assailants, and cut off
Hake's hand, but in the end he had to bite the dust.
The berserk then rode to his house and carried away
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Ragnhild and Guttorm, besides much valuable
property. He determined to marry Ragnhild and
would have done so at once, if his wound had not
grown constantly more painful. At Yule-tide, when
King Halfdan came to feast in Hedemark, he heard
of the outrage and resolved to punish it. He sent
one of his trusted warriors, named Haarek Gand, with
a hundred armed men to Hake's house; they arrived
in the early morning before any one was awake.
They set sentinels at all the doors, then broke into
the sleeping-rooms and carried off Sigurd Hjort's
children and the stolen goods. Then they set fire
to the house and burned it up. Hake escaped, but
seeing Ragnhild drive gayly away over the ice with
King Halfdan's men, he threw himself upon his
sword and perished. Halfdan the Swarthy became
enamored of Ragnhild, as soon as he saw her, and
made her his wife.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_12" id="Footnote_A_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_12"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Berserks or berserkir were champions of extraordinary strength,
who in battle were possessed with a sanguinary fury which made them
irresistible. Many of them were reputed to be were-wolves, and to
be invulnerable.</p></div>

<p>While Queen Ragnhild was with child she dreamed
marvellous dreams. Once she seemed to be standing
in the garden, trying to take a thorn out of her chemise,
but the thorn grew in her hand until it was like
a long spindle&mdash;the one end of which struck root in
the earth, while the other shot up into the air. Presently
it looked like a big tree, and it grew bigger and
bigger and taller and taller, until she stood in its
shade and her eye could scarcely reach to the top
of it. The lower part of the tree was red as blood;
further up the trunk was green and fair, and the
branches were radiantly white like snow. They
were, however, of very unequal size, and it seemed
to her that they spread out over the whole kingdom
of Norway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>King Halfdan was much puzzled at hearing this
dream, and perhaps a little jealous too. Why was it
that his wife had such remarkable dreams, while he
had none? He consulted a wise man as to the
cause of this, and was by him advised to sleep in a
pig-sty; then he would be sure to have remarkable
dreams. The king did as he had been told, and
dreamed that his hair was growing very long and
beautiful. It fell in bright locks about his head
and shoulders, but the locks were of unequal length
and color; some seemed like little curly knots just
sprouting from his scalp, while others hung down
over his back, even unto the waist. But one lock
there was that was brighter and more beautiful than
all the rest.</p>

<p>The king related this dream to his sage friend, who
interpreted it to mean that a mighty race of kings
should spring from him, and that his descendants,
though some of them should attain to great glory,
should be unequal in fame. But one of them should
be greater and more glorious than all the rest. The
longest and brightest lock, says Snorre, was supposed
to indicate Olaf the Saint.</p>

<p>When her time came, the queen bore a son who
was named Harold. He grew rapidly in stature
as in intelligence, and was much liked by all
men. He was fond of manly sports and won admiration
by his strength and his beauty. His
mother loved him much, while his father often
looked upon him with disfavor. Of his childhood
many tales are told which cannot lay claim to credibility.
Thus, it is said, that once, while King Half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>dan
was celebrating Yule-tide on Hadeland, all the
dishes and the ale suddenly disappeared from the
table. The guests went home, and the king, full of
wrath, remained sitting. In order to find out who
had dared thus to trifle with his dignity, he seized a
Finn, who was a sorcerer, and tormented him. The
Finn appealed to Harold, who, contrary to his
father's command, rescued him and followed him to
the mountains. After a while, they came to a place
where a chieftain was having a grand feast with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
men. There they remained until spring, and when
Harold was about to take his leave, his host said to
him: "Your father took it much to heart that I
took some meat and beer away from him last winter;
but for what you did to me I will reward you with
glad tidings. Your father is now dead, and you will
go home and inherit his kingdom. But some day
you will be king of all Norway."</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">BUCKLE WITH BYZANTINE ORNAMENTATION, FOUND AT HOEN IN EKER.</span>
</div>

<p>When Harold returned home, he found that the
chieftain had spoken the truth. His father had been
drowned while driving across the ice on the Randsfjord
(860). He was mourned by all his people; for
there had been good crops during his reign, and he
had been a wise ruler and much beloved. When it
was rumored that he was to be buried in Ringerike,
the men of Hadeland and of Raumarike came and
demanded that the corpse be given to them for
burial. For they believed that the favor of the gods
would rest upon the district where the king's barrow
was. At last they agreed to divide the body into
four parts. The men of Ringerike kept the trunk;
the head was buried at Skiringssal in Vestfold;
and the rest was divided between Hadeland and
Hedemark. For a long time, sacrifices were made
upon these barrows, and King Halfdan was worshipped
as a god.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>HAROLD THE FAIRHAIRED (860-930).</h3>


<p>Harold was only ten years old when his father
died, and the kings whom Halfdan had conquered
thought that the chance was now favorable for recovering
what they had lost. But Harold's guardian
Guttorm, his mother's brother, conducted the government
with power and ability, and assisted his
nephew in his efforts to put down his enemies.
A long series of battles was fought in which Harold
was usually victorious. It was but natural that the
young king, flushed with success, should resolve to
extend his domain. He knew that there was no
king in Norway whose power and resources were
equal to his own, and the determination to conquer
the whole country may therefore have naturally
ripened in his mind. Snorre, however, tells a
different story, and as it is a very pretty one, it may
be worth repeating.</p>

<p>There was a maid named Gyda, the daughter of
King Erik of H&ouml;rdaland; she was being fostered by
a rich yeoman in Valders. When Harold heard of
her beauty, he sent his men to her and asked her to
become his mistress. The maid's eyes flashed with
anger while she listened to this message, and throwing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
her head back proudly she answered: "Tell your
master that I will not sacrifice my maidenly honor
for a king who has only a few counties to rule over.
Strange it seems to me that there is no king here
who can conquer all Norway, as King Erik has conquered
Sweden and King Gorm Denmark."<a name="FNanchor_A_13" id="FNanchor_A_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_13" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_13" id="Footnote_A_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_13"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> King Gorm had not at that time conquered Denmark.</p></div>

<p>The messengers, amazed at her insolence, warned
her to give a more conciliatory answer. King Harold
was surely good enough for her, they thought; but
she would not listen to them. When, at last, they
took their leave, she followed them out and said:</p>

<p>"Give this message from me to King Harold. I
will promise to become his wedded wife, on this
condition, that he shall for my sake conquer all Norway,
and rule over it as freely as King Erik rules
over Sweden and King Gorm over Denmark. For
only then can he be called the king of a people."<a name="FNanchor_B_14" id="FNanchor_B_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_14" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_14" id="Footnote_B_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_14"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Tjodkonungr.</p></div>

<p>When the messengers returned, they advised the
king to break the girl's pride by sending them to
take her by force. But the king answered: "This
maid has not spoken ill and does not deserve to be
punished. On the contrary, she deserves much thanks
for her words. She has put something into my mind,
of which I wonder that it has not occurred to me
before. But this I now solemnly vow, and call God
to witness who made me and rules over all, that
I will not cut or comb my hair until the day when I
shall have conquered all Norway; or if I do not, I
shall die in the attempt."</p>

<p>Guttorm praised Harold for these words, saying,
that he had spoken like a king.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with his promise, the young king
now set about the task which he had undertaken.
He went northward with an army and conquered
Orkdale and Tr&ouml;ndelag, the district about the Drontheim
Fjord. In Naumdale, north of Drontheim,
there were two kings named Herlaug and Rollaug.
The former, when he heard of Harold's march of
conquest, built a great barrow, into which he entered
with eleven of his men and had it closed behind him.
Rollaug, his brother, ordered his royal high-seat to
be carried to the top of a hill, and an earl's seat to
be placed below, at the foot of the hill. He seated
himself in the royal seat, but when he saw Harold
approaching, he rolled from the king's seat into the
earl's seat, thereby declaring himself to be King
Harold's vassal. Harold tied a sword about his
waist, hung a shield about his neck, and made him
Earl of Naumdale.</p>

<p>Wherever he went, Harold pursued the same
policy. The old kings who acknowledged his overlordship
he reinstated as his earls in their former
dominions. Those who opposed him be killed or
maimed. The earls were really governors or representatives
of the king's authority. They administered
justice in the king's name, and collected taxes,
of which they were entitled to keep one third on condition
of entertaining sixty warriors, subject to the
king's command. Each earl had under him four or
more <i>hersir</i> (sub-vassals), who held in fief a royal
estate, of an income of twenty marks, on condition
of keeping twenty warriors ready to serve the king.
It will be seen that the feudal principle was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
basis of Harold's state. He deprived the peasants of
their allodium, and declared all land to be the property
of the king. The cultivators of the soil, from
having been free proprietors, became the tenants of
the king, and in so far as they were permitted to
retain their inherited estates, derived this privilege
no more from allodial but from feudal right. It
followed that the king could levy a tax on all land,
and that every man who refused to pay the tax
forfeited his title. Also a personal tax, which the
peasants derisively called the nose-tax (because it was
levied in every household according to the number
of noses), is said to have been exacted by Harold,
and to have caused much dissatisfaction. It is added
that many of the former kings who accepted earldoms
from him, found themselves in a better position,
both financially and as to authority, than they
had been before. And this is scarcely to be wondered
at. Their royal title had conferred upon them
no rights except such as their people voluntarily
conceded to them, and their chief privilege amounted
to a usage rather than a right to assume command
in war, and conduct the public sacrifices. Still it was
only in rare cases that they were willing to exchange
this shadowy authority for the real power which
Harold, by right of conquest, conferred upon them.</p>

<p>A still greater antagonism did the introduction of
the feudal land tenure arouse among the free yeomanry,
who in their fierce independence could not
endure any relation of enforced obedience and
subordination. Therefore rebellions against the royal
authority, on a smaller or greater scale, were of con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>stant
occurrence during the first half of Harold's reign,
and there are even indications that they continued
much longer. Many of his provinces he had to conquer
twice, and it was only the enormous odds in his
favor, and the promptness and severity of his punishments,
which at length forced the disloyal to accept
his sway. It required an energy and resolution such
as his to make a nation of all these scattered, predatory,
and often mutually hostile tribes; and his uniform
and systematic policy, as well as his uncompromising
sternness, in dealing with resistance, show that
he was fully conscious of the magnitude of his task.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to enumerate the battles he
fought and the victories he won. With every year
that passed he approached nearer to his goal&mdash;to be
the ruler of all Norway. Many of the mightiest men
in the land who had hitherto held aloof now offered
him their services, and were glad to accept honors at
his hands. Among these were the earl Haakon Grjotgardsson
of Haalogaland, and Ragnvald, late earl of
M&ouml;re, who was the father of Duke Rollo of Normandy,
and through William the Conqueror the
ancestor of the kings of England. Ragnvald was a
brave and sagacious man, who assisted the king with
counsel and with deeds, and became his most intimate
friend and adviser.</p>

<p>Less readily did the men of the great Rafnista
family accept Harold's overtures. Kveld-Ulf (Night-Wolf)
pleaded old age, when the king sent messengers
to him, requesting him to enter his service.
This was the more disappointing to Harold, because
he had counted on Kveld-Ulf's using the great influ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>ence
which he wielded, in his favor. He sent messengers
once more and offered Kveld-Ulf's son, Bald
Grim, high dignities if he would become his vassal.
But Bald Grim replied that he would accept no
dignity which would raise him in rank above his
father. Then the king's patience was exhausted, and
he would have resorted to other arguments than
verbal ones, if Kveld-Ulf's brother-in-law, Oelve
Nuva, had not interceded in his behalf. Oelve finally
obtained the old chieftain's consent to have his
second son Thorolf enter the king's service if he saw
fit. Thorolf was then out on a viking cruise with
Oelve's brother, Eyvind Lambe, but he was expected
home in the autumn. On their return, both accepted
Harold's offer and became his men. Thorolf
particularly rose rapidly in the king's favor, on account
of his intelligence, beauty, and courtly manners.
The old Kveld-Ulf, however, looked with
suspicion upon their friendship, and hinted that he
expected that nothing good would come of it.</p>

<p>The kings of Sweden had from of old had claims
on that part of Norway which is called Viken.<a name="FNanchor_A_15" id="FNanchor_A_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_15" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Also
Vermeland, which since the days of Olaf the
Woodcutter had belonged to the Ynglings, was
declared to be an integral part of Sweden, and
the Swedish king, Erik Eimundsson, seized the
opportunity, while Harold was occupied with his
conquests in the north, to invade the latter province,
besides Ranrike and portions of Vingulmark.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_15" id="Footnote_A_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_15"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Viken was the country about the present Christiania Fjord, and
was divided into Vestfold, Vingulmark, and Ranrike (the present Bohuslen
in Sweden).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p></div>

<p>When these tidings reached Harold, he hastened
southward, fined and punished those of the peasants
who had promised allegiance to his enemy,
and finally went northward to Vermeland where,
by a singular coincidence, he met the Swedish king
at a great feast given by the mighty yeoman Aake.
Probably to avoid bloodshed, the two kings and their
warriors were entertained in separate buildings;
but while Harold and his men were lodged in the
new mansion and made to eat and drink out of new
horns and precious dishes, Erik's party were made to
enjoy their cheer in an old building, and their horns
and dishes, though artfully wrought, were not new.
When the time came for leaving, Aake brought his
son to Harold and begged him to take him into his
service. At this Erik grew very wroth and rode
away. Aake hastened to accompany him; and when
asked why he had made such a difference in the
entertainment, he replied that it was because Erik
was old, while Harold was young.</p>

<p>"Thou must indeed remember that thou art my
man," said King Erik.</p>

<p>"When thou sayest that I am thy man," answered
the yeoman, "then I may say with equal right that
thou art my man."</p>

<p>This answer so angered the king that he drew his
sword and killed Aake. Harold, when he heard of
his death, pursued his slayer but did not succeed
in overtaking him.</p>

<p>The princes and chieftains who had opposed
Harold had, so far, accomplished nothing but their
own ruin. Those who still retained their lands con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>cluded
that separately they could never hope to prevail
against him, and they therefore united and met
the conqueror in 872 with a great fleet in the Hafrs-Fjord.<a name="FNanchor_A_16" id="FNanchor_A_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_16" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The war-horns were blown, and King Harold's
ship was foremost, wherever the fight was
hottest. In its prow stood Thorolf, the son of Kveld-Ulf,
who fought with splendid bravery, and the
brothers Oelve Nuva and Eyvind Lambe. The
issue seemed long doubtful, and many of the king's
best men were slain; spears and stones rained down
in showers, and the arrows flew hissing through the
air. At last, Harold's <i>berserks</i>, seized with a wild
fury, stormed forward, and boarded the enemies'
ships. The carnage was terrible, and one by one
the chieftains fell or fled. King Harold here won
(as the sagas relate) one of the greatest battles that
was ever fought in Norway; and there was from this
day no longer any formidable opposition to him.
Among the many who were wounded at Hafrs-Fjord
was Thorolf, and in fact all who had stood before
the mast in the king's ship, except the <i>berserks</i>. The
scald Thorbj&ouml;rn Hornklove made a song about the
victory, fragments of which are still extant.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_16" id="Footnote_A_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_16"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Hafrs-Fjord is a little fjord in Jaederen, west of the present city
of Stavanger</p></div>

<p>At a feast which shortly after the battle was given
in his honor, Harold's hair was cut by Ragnvald, the
earl of M&ouml;re, and all marvelled at its beauty. While
he had formerly been called Harold Lufa, <i>i. e.</i>, the
Frowsy-headed, he was now named Harold the Fairhaired.
Having now accomplished what he had set
out to do, he married Gyda. The romance is, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>spoiled by the fact that he had some years before
married Aasa, the daughter of the earl, Haakon<a name="FNanchor_A_17" id="FNanchor_A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_17" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Grjotgardsson, and had by her three sons&mdash;Halfdan
the White, Halfdan the Swarthy, and Sigfrid. The
sons Gyda bore him were named Guttorm, Haarek,
and Gudr&ouml;d.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_17" id="Footnote_A_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_17"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The letter <i>aa</i> in Norwegian (Icelandic <i>&aacute;</i>) is pronounced like the
English <i>aw</i> in <i>hawk</i>. Haakon is therefore pronounced Hawkon;
Aasa, Awsa, etc. The modern Icelanders pronounce the sound like
<i>ou</i> in <i>out</i>, <i>rout</i>. They say Houkon, Hourek, etc.</p></div>

<p>In his relations with men Harold was no more
faithful than in his relations with women. He was
a man of indomitable will and courage, sagacious
and far-seeing; shunning no means for the accomplishment
of his ends. He could not, however, endure
the characteristics in others which he valued in
himself. When his jealousy was once aroused, it
was not easily again allayed. As is the manner of
tyrants, he was apt to humiliate those the most whom
he had most exalted, and his suspicion often fell
upon those who least deserved it. The first victim
of his jealousy was Thorolf, the son of Kveld-Ulf,
who, after the battle of Hafrs-Fjord, had stood especially
high in his favor.</p>

<p>Thorolf had by a wealthy marriage and by inheritance
accumulated a large fortune and lived in
princely style. His liberality and winning exterior
made him hosts of friends, and his thrift and ability
procured him the means to practise a magnificent
hospitality. The king had made him his <i>sysselmand</i>,
or bailiff, in Haalogaland, and Thorolf particularly
distinguished himself by the energy and shrewdness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>which he displayed in collecting the tax from the
Finns, who, as a rule, were not anxious to make contributions
to the royal treasury. During a journey
which Harold made through Haalogaland, Thorolf
made a feast for him, the splendor of which had
never been equalled in those parts of the country.
There were in all eight hundred guests&mdash;five hundred
of whom Thorolf had invited, while three hundred
were the attendants of the king. To the astonishment
of his host, Harold sat, dark and silent, in
the high-seat, and seemed ill-pleased with the efforts
that were made to entertain him. Toward the end
of the feast he repressed his ill-humor, however, and
when his host at parting presented him with a large
dragon-ship with complete equipment, he seemed
much pleased. Nevertheless, it was not long before
he deprived him of his office as royal bailiff,
then espoused the cause of his enemies, and used all
sorts of contemptible slanders as a pretext for attacking
him on his estate, Sandness, and burning his
house. When Thorolf broke out through the burning
wall, he was received with a hail-storm of spears.
Seeing the king he rushed toward him, with
drawn sword, and cut down his banner-bearer; then,
when his foe was almost within reach of his sword,
fell, crying: "By three steps only I failed." It was
said that Harold himself gave him his death-wound,
and he later avowed himself as his slayer to the old
Kveld-Ulf. When he saw his former friend lying
dead at his feet, he looked sadly at him; and when
a man passed him who was busy bandaging a slight
wound, he said: "That wound Thorolf did not give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
thee; for differently did weapons bite in his hands.
It is a great pity that such men must perish."</p>

<p>When Kveld-Ulf heard of his son's death, his grief
was so great that he had to go to bed. But when
he heard that it was the king who had slain him, and
that he had fallen prone at his slayer's feet, he got up
and was well content. For when a dying man fell
on his face, it was a sign that he would be avenged.
In the meanwhile, being far from powerful enough
to attack Harold openly, the old man gathered all
his family and his goods and set out for Iceland; but
lingered long along the coast of Norway, in the hope
of finding some one of Harold's race upon whom he
could wreak vengeance. In this he was successful.
The two sons of Guttorm, Harold's uncle and former
guardian, were sailing northward with two of
the king's men. These Bald Grim and Kveld-Ulf
attacked, killed the king's cousins, and captured the
ship. Then, wild with exultation, Bald Grim
mounted the prow and sang:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
Now is the Hersir's vengeance<br />
On the king fulfilled.<br />
Wolf and eagle tread on<br />
Yngling's children.<br />
Seaward swept flew Halvard's<br />
Lacerated corpse,<br />
And the eagle's beak<br />
Tears Snarfare's wounds.<br />
</div>

<p>From that time forth, there was a blood-feud between
the Yngling race and Kveld-Ulf's descendants,
and the famous saga of Egil, Bald Grim's son, tells
of a long chain of bloody deeds which all had their
origin in the king's treachery to Thorolf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Kveld-Ulf and Bald Grim were not the only chieftains
who sought refuge abroad from Harold's oppression.
After the battle of Hafrs-Fjord, when the
king proceeded with uncompromising rigor to enforce
the feudal system, several thousand men,
many of whom belonged to the noblest families of
the land, crossed the sea, and found new homes in
the Orkneys and the Hebrides, whence again many
found their way to Iceland. A great number also
sailed direct for the latter country, and the so-called
Landnama book (the Domesday Book of Iceland)
has preserved the names, and, at times, bits of the
history of the most important original settlers.
Much as we may sympathize with the indomitable
spirit which made these men sacrifice home and
country for a principle, there is also another view of
the case which has to be considered. Harold the
Fairhaired was founding a state, which would support
a higher civilization than could possibly be
developed among a loose agglomeration of semi-hostile
tribes. The idea of a national unity, which
was the inspiration of his work, required the enforcement
of an organic system which to the independent
chieftains must have appeared extremely oppressive.
The payment of taxes, which to the
citizen of the modern state is not apt to appear
humiliating, seemed to the Norse chieftains unworthy
of a freeman. When Harold commanded
them to refrain from robbing and plundering expeditions
within the confines of his kingdom, they felt
outraged, and could see no reason why they should
submit to such unwarrantable curtailment of time-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>honored
privileges. One of them, Rolf, or Rollo,
son of the king's friend, Ragnvald, Earl of M&ouml;re, defied
the order, made <i>strand-hug</i><a name="FNanchor_A_18" id="FNanchor_A_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_18" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in Viken, and was
declared an outlaw. Neither his father's influence,
nor his mother's prayers, could save him. Just on
account of his high birth, Harold was determined to
make an example of him.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_18" id="Footnote_A_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_18"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Strand-hug was an enforced provisioning of the viking fleet from
the nearest inhabited country. It was the common practice of
vikings to make strand-hug, wherever they might happen to be.</p></div>

<p>Rollo is known in the Norse sagas as Rolf the
Walker, because he was so tall and heavy that no
horse could carry him. With a large number of followers
he sailed southward to France, and after
having harried the country for several years, made in
912 a compromise with King Charles the Simple, by
which he was to accept Christianity and receive a large
province in fief for himself and his descendants.
This province was named Normandy; and has played
a large r&ocirc;le in the history of the world. It is told of
Rollo that when he was requested to kiss the king's
foot in token of fealty, he answered: "I will never
bend my knee before any man; nor will I kiss any
one's foot." After much persuasion, however, he
permitted one of his men to perform the act of
homage for him. His proxy stalked sullenly forward,
and pausing before the king, who was on horse-back,
seized his foot and lifted it to his lips. By this
man&#339;uvre, the king came to make a somersault, at
which there was great laughter among the Norsemen.
Rollo did literally, like the poor boy in the fairy tale,
marry the princess and get half the kingdom. For, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>is told, that Charles gave him for a bride his daughter
Gisla, who, however, died childless. He ruled his
duchy with a rod of iron; and he must have learned
a useful lesson from King Harold, for it is said that he
restrained robbery with a firm hand, and hanged the
robbers. So great was the public security in his day,
that the peasants could leave their ploughs and tools
in the field over night without fear of losing them.
Rollo's son was William Longsword, who was the
father of Richard the Fearless, who again had a son
of his own name. This latter Richard, surnamed
the Good, had a son named Rollo, or Robert<a name="FNanchor_A_19" id="FNanchor_A_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_19" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> the
Magnificent, who was the father of William the Conqueror.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_19" id="Footnote_A_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_19"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The first Duke Rollo had, when he was baptized, assumed the
name Robert.</p></div>

<p>The emigration of the discontented yeomen and
chieftains removed the last obstacle to the organization
of Harold's feudal state. According to an approximately
accurate calculation, about eight hundred
heads of families went with their households to Iceland,
to the Scottish isles, and to Jemteland, leaving
behind them estates which were promptly confiscated
by the king. Those who endeavored to sell their lands
met with small success; for to buy the property of emigrants
was considered as an act hostile to the king.
Great wealth was thus accumulated in Harold's hands,
and the means of rewarding his friends at the expense
of his enemies were at his disposal. The emigrants
were, therefore, doubly instrumental in cementing
the state which they had endeavored to destroy. A
large number of officials were needed to superintend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the great landed estates, and Harold chose these
from his immediate dependents. The so-called
Aarmaend were merely superintendents or stewards,
who took charge of the crown lands, and forwarded
to the king his share of the income. They were
often thralls or freedmen, and were looked down
upon by the yeomanry as their inferiors. The earls,
on the other hand, who belonged to the old tribal
aristocracy, held their land in fief, and were, in a
limited sense, proprietors, though their sons could
not, by any absolute right, claim to inherit them. It
was, however, the custom to continue such estates
from father to son. The third class of property was
the land which the yeomanry had formerly held by
allodial right, and which they now held with as much
security and right of inheritance, as the king's nominal
tenants. As long as they paid their taxes, it was
of course in the king's interest to leave them unmolested.</p>

<p>It was natural that with his great wealth Harold
should keep a court of exceptional splendor. He
was fond of song and story and always kept scalds
about him who sang his praise and glorified his
deeds. He could be generous when the occasion
demanded, and would then scatter his gold with
royal liberality. But in little things he was reputed
to be mean; and it was a common complaint among
his courtiers that they did not get enough to eat.
Some legends recounted by Snorre show that with
all his stern inflexibility toward men, he was easily
deceived by women. Thus, it is related that once,
while he was at a Yule-tide feast, in Guldbrandsdale,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a Finn came to him and persuaded him to accompany
him to his tent. There he showed the king a
girl named Snefrid, whose beauty made a great impression
upon him. He chatted with her for a
while; then drank a goblet of mead which the Finn
brought him. No sooner had he swallowed the
liquid than he became so enamoured of Snefrid that
he refused to leave her, and demanded that she
should that very day become his wife. He loved
her with such abandonment and passion that he
neglected the government and lived only for her.
She bore him five sons in rapid succession, and then
died. Harold's grief knew no bounds. He refused
to have her buried, but sat staring at her beautiful
corpse, night and day. For, oddly enough, it is told
that Snefrid's beauty remained unchanged after
death, and there was no sign of decay. All the
king's men feared that he had lost his reason, and
one of them finally persuaded him, on some pretext,
to have the corpse moved. But the very instant it
was touched, the most hideous change occurred.
The flesh turned blue, and a terrible stench filled
the room. The king then recovered his reason, and
ordered the body to be burned. But when it was
placed on the pyre, snakes, adders, toads, and horrible
creeping things teemed in and about it, so that
no one could endure the sight of it. Then Harold
comprehended that he had been the victim of sorcery;
and he grew so angry that he chased away
from him the children Snefrid had borne him. And
yet, strangely enough, it was this branch which endured
the longest, and from which a long line of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
kings descended. The names of Snefrid's sons were
Sigurd Rise (Giant), Gudr&ouml;d Ljome, Halfdan Haalegg
(Longlegs), and Ragnvald Rettilbeine.</p>

<p>The only one of King Harold's wives who was of
royal birth was Ragnhild, the daughter of King Erik
the Younger in South Jutland. She replied, when he
first sent messengers to woo her, that she would not
marry the mightiest king in all the world, if she had
to put up with one thirtieth part of his affection. To
a second message she replied that she would marry
King Harold if he would put away all his other
wives. This he consented to do, and made Ragnhild
his queen. She lived, however, only three years
after her marriage; and Harold then took back
several of his former wives and mistresses. Ragnhild
had left him one son, Erik, whom he loved the most
of all his children.</p>

<p>Marriage was entirely a civil contract during the
days of Germanic paganism and was in no wise
associated with religion or religious ceremonies. It
was an easy thing for a husband to obtain a divorce
from his wife, but it was customary to go through
with this formality before marrying a second. Open
polygamy, as practised by Harold, was contrary to
custom and must have been regarded with reprobation
by the people. For all that, Harold was, during
the latter part of his reign, a popular ruler and well
beloved both by yeomanry and chieftains.</p>

<p>As his children grew up, Harold began to reap
some of the disadvantages of his scattered family relations.
His sons, having different mothers, and
having been fostered by yeomen in different parts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the country, could scarcely be strongly conscious of
their kinship. They were jealous of each other,
and particularly jealous of the mighty earls who sat
like little kings upon their estates ruling over land
and people. It was to give vent to this feeling that
Halfdan Longlegs and Gudr&ouml;d Ljome, without any
warning, attacked Ragnvald, the Earl of M&ouml;re, and
burned him up with sixty of his men. When Harold
heard of this dastardly deed, he gathered an army
and resolved to punish his sons. Gudr&ouml;d, who had
taken possession of the earldom after Ragnvald, surrendered
without fighting, while Halfdan Longlegs
sailed with three ships for the Orkneys, where he
chased away Turf-Einar, the son of the Earl of
M&ouml;re, and made himself king of the islands. Turf-Einar
returned, however, surprised Halfdan, and put
him to death in a barbarous manner. Although
Halfdan had been a rebel against the king's authority,
and Turf-Einar in slaying him had avenged his
own father, Harold had no choice but to wreak
vengeance upon the slayer of his son. He accordingly
sailed with a fleet for the Orkneys, opened
negotiations with Turf-Einar, and accepted as "blood-atonement"
sixty marks in gold. Whether it was
on the same occasion that he made a cruise to
Scotland, harrying the coast, is perhaps, doubtful.
His chief purpose, as on a previous cruise in the
same waters, was to break up the various nests of
vikings, who from this convenient retreat made frequent
attacks upon the coast of Norway during the
summer months.</p>

<p>A fertile cause of disagreement among Harold's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sons was their jealousy of Erik, whom their father
conspicuously favored. When he was twelve years
old, Erik was given five ships to command, and
with a choice crew went on viking cruises. Much
did the old king delight in hearing the tales of his
prowess, and the daring enterprises in which he had
played a part. The ominous surname "Blod-Oexe"
(Blood-Axe) which the lad acquired by his deeds in
battle only endeared him the more to his father. It
was his love of this favorite son which induced him in
his fiftieth year (900) to commit an act, whereby he
virtually undid the great work of his life and brought
misery upon unborn generations. He called a <i>thing</i>
or general assembly of the people, probably at Eidsvold,
and made all his sons kings, on condition that
they should, after his death, acknowledge Erik as
their overlord. To each he gave a province to govern,
permitting him to keep one third of the revenues
for himself, leaving one third for the earls, and sending
one third to the sovereign. The royal title
should be inherited by all his direct descendants in
the male line, legitimate or illegitimate birth making
no difference. To the sons of his daughters he gave
earldoms. In this disastrous act of Harold, making
no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate
children, lies the germ of the civil wars and terrible
internecine conflicts which ravaged the kingdom he
had established and exhausted its powers, until for
four hundred years it sank out of sight, and its name
seemed to have been blotted out from among the
nations. It seems incredible that the wisdom and
energy which had built up a great state could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
coupled with the unwisdom and the weakness which
in the end broke it down again. Harold evidently
looked upon the royal office as a piece of personal
property which he had by his sword acquired, and
which all his male descendants had an equal right to
inherit. At the same time he must, after the experience
he had had with his sons, have known them
too well to suppose that they would peacefully
acquiesce in his decision, living together in fraternal
unity. If he cherished any illusion, Erik lost no
time in dispelling it. He first killed Ragnvald Rettilbeine,
the son of Snefrid, because he was said to
be a sorcerer. Next he attacked his brother Bj&ouml;rn
the Merchant (Farmand) because he declined to pay
him tribute, killed him and plundered his house. Halfdan
the Swarthy (Svarte) in Drontheim resolved to
avenge this outrage, concluding that none of Harold's
sons were safe, as long as Erik was permitted, with
impunity, to take the law into his own hands. While
Erik was feasting at the farm, Selven, Halfdan
surrounded the house and set fire to it. Erik succeeded
in escaping with four men, and he hastened
southward to complain to his father. King Harold,
it is told, was greatly incensed, collected his fleet and
sailed to Drontheim, where Halfdan, though with an
inferior force, stood ready to meet him. The battle
was about to begin, when the scald, Guttorm Sindre,
reminded the two kings of a promise they had made
him. Once he had sung a song in their honor, and
as he refused all the gifts they offered him, they both
swore that whatever he should ask of them, they
would fulfil. "Now," he said, "I have come to
claim the guerdon of my song."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Hard as it was, they could not break their royal
promise. Peace was made, and father and son separated.
Halfdan was permitted to keep his province,
but had to vow solemnly that he would henceforth
make no hostile demonstration against Erik. For
all that the hatred between the two lasted, though
curbed for a while by the
fear of the king.</p>

<p>When Harold was nearly
seventy years old, he
took for his mistress
Thora of Moster, who on
account of her great height
was surnamed Moster-stang
(Moster-pole). She
bore him a son who was
named Haakon. Much
dissatisfaction was there
among the king's other
sons when this late-comer
made his appearance, and
he would probably not
have grown to manhood,
if an incident had not occurred
which removed him beyond their reach. The
story told by Snorre in this connection is full of interest,
but sounds incredible. Once, it is told, messengers
arrived from King Ethelstan in England, bringing a
precious sword to King Harold, who accepted it and
returned thanks.</p>

<p>"Now," said the messengers, "thou hast taken
the sword, as our king wished, and thou art therefore
his sword-taker or vassal."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Harold was angry at having been thus tricked, but
did not molest the messengers. The next year, however,
he sent his young son Haakon with an embassy
to Ethelstan. They found the king in London, and
were well received by him. The spokesman of the
embassy then placed the boy, Haakon, on Ethelstan's
knee, saying, "King Harold begs thee to
foster this child of his servant-maid."</p>

<p>Ethelstan angrily drew his sword, as if he would
kill the child; but the spokesman said: "Now that
thou hast once put him upon thy knee, thou mayst
murder him, if it please thee; but thereby hast thou
not slain all King Harold's sons."</p>

<p>To foster another man's child was in Norway regarded
as an acknowledgment of inferiority; and
Harold had thus repaid Ethelstan in his own coin.
There are, however, several circumstances which
make the story suspicious. In the first place Ethelstan
and his ancestors had had too severe an experience
of Norsemen and Danes to wish to challenge
the mightiest of them by a wanton insult; and again,
it is more credible that Harold sent his youngest son
out of the country for his own safety,<a name="FNanchor_A_20" id="FNanchor_A_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_20" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> than in order
to play an undignified trick upon a foreign king.
At all events, Haakon was treated with the greatest
kindness by the English king, and won his affection.</p>

<p>When Harold the Fairhaired was eighty years
old, he felt no longer able to bear the burden of the
government. He therefore led Erik to his royal
high-seat, and abdicated in his favor. Three years
later he died (933), after having ruled over Norway
for seventy-three years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>ERIK BLOOD-AXE (930-935).</h3>


<p>While Harold's despotism had been civilizing
and, on the whole, beneficent, that of Erik Blood-Axe
was disorganizing and destructive. With him
the old turbulent viking spirit ascended the throne.
Power meant with him the means of gratifying every
savage impulse. Brave he was, delighting in battle;
cruel and pitiless; and yet not without a certain
sense of fairness and occasional impulses of generosity.
In person he was handsome, of stately
presence, but haughty and taciturn. Unhappily he
married a woman who weakened all that was good
in him and strengthened all that was bad. Queen
Gunhild possessed a baneful influence over him
during his entire life. She was cruel, avaricious, and
treacherous, and was popularly credited with all the
ill deeds which her husband committed. There are
strange legends about her, attributing to witchcraft
the power she had over every one who came in contact
with her. According to Snorre, Erik met her in
Finmark, whither she had been sent by her parents
to learn sorcery. For the Finns were in those days
credited with a deep knowledge of the black art.
The two sorcerers with whom she was staying were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
both determined to marry her, and like the princess
in the fairy-tale, she concealed Prince Erik in her
tent, and begged him to rid her of her troublesome
suitors. This, in spite of many difficulties, Erik did,
carried Gunhild away to his ships, and made her his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wife. She was, it is said, small of stature, insinuating,
and of extraordinary beauty; but she was the
evil genius of her husband, egging him on to deeds of
treachery and violence which made him detested by his
people. It was in great part the disfavor with which
she was regarded which raised rebels against Erik's
authority in various parts of the country and brought
popular support to his brothers in their endeavor to
cast off his yoke. In spite of his father's efforts,
Erik's sovereignty had not been universally recognized,
and no sooner was King Harold dead than
Halfdan the Swarthy declared himself to be sovereign
in Tr&ouml;ndelag and Olaf<a name="FNanchor_A_21" id="FNanchor_A_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_21" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in Viken. A few
years after that, however, Halfdan died suddenly,
and the rumor said that he had been poisoned by
Queen Gunhild. The men of Tr&ouml;ndelag then chose
his brother Sigfrid for their king, and Erik found his
kingdom gradually shrinking both from the north
and the south. Being prepared for an attack from
Erik, Sigfrid and Olaf determined to join their forces,
and to complete all arrangements, the former went
to visit the latter in Tunsberg. When Erik heard
of this, he went in haste to the town with a large
number of men, and surprised and killed both his
brothers. Olaf's son Tryggve escaped, however, and
was kept in concealment, as long as Erik was master
in the land.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_21" id="Footnote_A_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_21"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Olaf was the son of King Harold and Svanhild, a daughter of
Earl Eystein of Hedemark and Vestfold.</p></div>

<br />
<span class="caption">CYLINDRICAL MOUNTING OF BRONZE PROBABLY FOR THE SHAFT OF A
SPEAR. FOUND NEAR STAVANGER.</span>
</div>

<p>Erik had now killed four of his brothers, if not
five, and it was the common opinion that Gunhild
would not rest until she had exterminated all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
race of Harold the Fairhaired outside of her husband's
line.</p>

<p>While Erik was a youth, he had made the acquaintance
of an Icelander named Thorolf, the son of
Skallagrim (Bald Grim) and nephew of Thorolf Kveld-Ulf's
son, whom King Harold had treacherously
slain. This Thorolf, like his uncle and namesake,
was a tall and handsome man, of fine presence and
winning manners. He had made Erik a present of
a ship, very beautifully built and decorated, and had
thereby gained his friendship. In return Erik had
obtained from his father permission for Thorolf to
remain unmolested in the country. The handsome
Icelander made many friends in Norway, among
whom two mighty men named Thore Herse and
Bj&ouml;rn the Yeoman. When he returned to Iceland
he brought with him, as a gift from the king to his
father, an axe with a handle of precious workmanship.
But Bald Grim, though he received his son well,
treated King Erik's gift with contempt, and finally,
when Thorolf again made a cruise to Norway, he
sang an insulting verse and begged to have it reported
to Erik. The axe he also wished to have returned.
Thorolf, who was determined not to revive the
ancient feud, threw the axe into the ocean, and
conveyed his father's thanks and greeting to the king.
If he had had his way, the blood-feud would have
been at an end. But he had a younger brother
named Egil,<a name="FNanchor_A_22" id="FNanchor_A_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_22" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who insisted upon bearing him company,
and he soon fanned the dying embers into
flame.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_22" id="Footnote_A_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_22"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Pronounced <i>Agil</i>, "g" hard, as in gimlet, gilt, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Egil was the very incarnation of the old untamable
Norse spirit, the turbulent and indomitable individualism,
which is incapable of considering any but personal
aims, and of submitting to any kind of discipline.
Like his father, Bald Grim, he was large of
stature, swarthy, and ill-favored, and displayed in his
childhood a fierce and revengeful spirit, but also a
rare gift of song, which, no less than his foolhardy
deeds, brought him fame during his long and adventurous
career.</p>

<p>The two brothers arrived safely in Norway and
became the guests of Thore Herse, between whose
son Arinbj&ouml;rn and Egil a warm friendship sprung
up. While Thorolf went to be married to Aasgerd,
the daughter of Bj&ouml;rn the Yeoman, Egil was forced
by a severe illness to remain at home. When he became
convalescent, he accompanied one of Thore's
overseers to a royal steward named Baard, and met
there King Erik and Queen Gunhild. Baard, in
his zeal to please the king, neglected the Icelander,
and when the latter became unruly, at a hint from
the queen, mixed soporific herbs in his beer. Egil's
suspicion was aroused, however, and he poured out
the beer and killed Baard. Then he ran for his life,
swam out to an island in the fjord, and when the
island was searched, killed some of those who had
been sent to find him; whereupon he made his escape
in their boat. Although King Erik was very
angry, he accepted the atonement in money which
Thore Herse offered for Baard's death, and was persuaded
to allow Egil to remain in the land. Queen
Gunhild was much incensed at his forgiving spirit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and asked if he counted the slaying of Baard as
naught; to which the king replied: "For ever thou
art egging me on to violence; but my word, once
given, I cannot break."</p>

<p>As no persuasions availed, Gunhild made up her
mind to use some one else as the instrument of her
retaliation. It is told that she had been fond of
Baard, whom Egil had slain; but as he was a man of
low birth, it was scarcely this personal fondness, but
rather a sense of outraged dignity which impelled
her to persevere in her plans of vengeance. At a
great sacrificial feast, at the temple of Gaule, she
made her brother, Eyvind Skreyja, promise to kill
one of Bald Grim's sons; but as no chance presented
itself, he slew instead one of Thorolf's men;
in return for which he was outlawed by Erik, as a
<i>vargr &#299; veum</i>&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, wolf in the sanctuary. The two
brothers now went on viking cruises, took service
under Ethelstan, in England, and fought under his
standard a great battle, in which Thorolf fell. Egil
now married his widow, Aasgerd, and returned with
her to Iceland. He had then been abroad for twelve
years. Hardly had he settled down, however, when
he learned that his father-in-law, Bj&ouml;rn the Yeoman,
was dead, and that one of Gunhild's favorites named
Berg-Anund, had taken possession of his property.
He therefore lost no time in returning to Norway,
and with his friend Arinbj&ouml;rn's aid pleaded his case
at the <i>Gulathing</i>, in the presence of the king and
queen. But the <i>thing</i> broke up in disorder, and
Egil had to sail back to Iceland without having accomplished
his purpose. Considerations of pru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>dence
had, however, no weight with him, and before
long he started for the third time for Norway, surprised
Berg-Anund, and killed not only him, but the
king's son Ragnvald, who was his guest. In order
to add insult to injury, he mounted a cliff, and raised
what was called a shame-pole, or pole of dishonor, to
Gunhild and the king. On the top of the pole he
put the head of a dead horse, while he called out in
a loud voice: "This dishonor do I turn against all
the land-spirits<a name="FNanchor_A_23" id="FNanchor_A_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_23" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> that inhabit this land, so that they
may all stray on wildering ways, and none of them
may chance or hit upon his home, until they shall
have chased King Erik and Gunhild from the land."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_23" id="Footnote_A_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_23"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The land-spirits were <i>genii loci</i>; the alliterative formula which
Egil pronounced was supposed to have magic power.</p></div>

<p>Thereupon he cut these words, in runes, into the
pole, and sailed back to Iceland. It seemed, too, as
if the curse took effect. For when Erik had been
four years upon the throne, his youngest brother,
Haakon, landed in Tr&ouml;ndelag, and the following year
was made king. The news ran like wildfire through
the country, and was everywhere received with jubilation.
Erik made a desperate effort to raise an
army, but the people turned away from him, and he
was obliged to flee with his wife and children, and a
few followers. Among those who remained faithful
to him was Egil's friend, Arinbj&ouml;rn. He now sailed
about as a viking, harrying the coasts of Scotland and
England, and finally accepted a portion of Northumberland
in fief from King Ethelstan, on condition
of defending the country against Norse and Danish
vikings. It was also stipulated that he should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
baptized and accept Christianity. Although the different
sagas which deal with Erik's later life give
somewhat conflicting accounts, it is obvious that he
was no more popular in England than he had been
in Norway. It appears that he was once, or probably
twice, expelled from Northumberland, but again
returned. By a most singular chance, a tempest here
drove his mortal enemy right into his clutches.</p>

<p>Egil, it is told, was restless and discontented at
home; and the common belief was that Gunhild
by sorcery had stolen his peace of mind. He wandered
uneasily along the strand and looked out for
sails, and took no pleasure in his wife and children.
Finally, when he could stay at home no longer, he
equipped a ship and sailed southward to England.
He was shipwrecked at the mouth of the Humber,
lost his ship, but saved himself and his thirty warriors.
From people whom he met, he learned that
Erik Blood-Axe ruled over the country; and knowing
that there was slight chance of escape, he rode
boldly into York and sought his friend Arinbj&ouml;rn.
Together they went to Erik, who inquired of Egil
how he could be so foolish, as to expect any thing but
death at his hands. Gunhild, when she saw him
demanded impatiently, that he should be killed on
the spot. She had thirsted so long for his blood;
she could not endure a moment's delay in her hotly-desired
vengeance. Erik, however, granted the Icelander
a respite until the next morning; Arinbj&ouml;rn
begged him, as a last bid for life, to spend the
night in composing a song in honor of Erik. This
Egil promised; and Arinbj&ouml;rn had food and drink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
brought to him and bade him do his best. Being
naturally anxious, he went to his friend in the night
and asked him how the song was progressing. Egil
replied that he had not been able to compose a line,
because there was a swallow sitting in the window
whose incessant screaming disturbed him, and he
could not chase it away. Arinbj&ouml;rn darted out into
the hall, and caught a glimpse of a woman, who
ran at the sight of him. At that very instant, too,
the swallow disappeared. To prevent her from returning,
Arinbj&ouml;rn seated himself outside of Egil's
door and kept watch through the night. For he
knew that the swallow was none other than the
queen, who by sorcery had assumed the guise of the
bird.</p>

<p>The next morning Egil had finished his song and
committed it to memory. Arinbj&ouml;rn now armed all
his men, and went with Egil and his warriors to the
king's house. He reminded Erik of his fidelity to
him, when others had forsaken him, and asked, as a
reward for his services, that his friend's life be
spared. Gunhild begged him to be silent; and the
king made no response. Then Arinbj&ouml;rn stepped
forward and declared that Egil should not die, until
he and his last man were dead.</p>

<p>"At that price," answered the king, "I would not
willingly buy Egil's death, although, he has amply
deserved whatever I may do to him."</p>

<p>Suddenly, when the king had spoken, Egil began
to recite with a clear, strong voice, and instantly
there was silence in the hall. This is a portion of his
song:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Erik sat immovable while Egil sang, watching
his face narrowly. When the song was at an end,
the king said: "The song is excellent, and I have
now considered what I will do for Arinbj&ouml;rn's sake.
Thou, Egil, shalt depart hence unharmed; because
I will not do the dastardly deed to kill a man who
gave himself voluntarily into my power. But from
the moment thou leavest this hall, thou shalt never
come before my eyes again, nor before the eyes of
my sons. Nor is this to be regarded as a reconciliation
between thee and me or my sons and kinsmen."
Thus Egil bought his head by his song, and
the song is therefore called "H&ouml;fudlausn," or "The
Ransom of the Head."</p>

<p>Egil then took his leave, visited Ethelstan once
more; went to Norway and had many adventures,
before he returned to Iceland, where he died between
990 and 995. He was then over ninety years old.<a name="FNanchor_A_31" id="FNanchor_A_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_31" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>

<p>Erik Blood-Axe remained in England and suffered
many vicissitudes of fate, until he fell in battle in 950
or 954. He is repeatedly mentioned by the English
chroniclers under the name of Erik Haroldson.
After his death Gunhild had a <i>draapa</i> composed in
his honor, an interesting fragment of which is still
extant. She then went to Denmark with her sons,
and was well received by the Danish king, Harold
Bluetooth (Blaatand), the son of Gorm the Old.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>HAAKON THE GOOD (935-961).</h3>


<p>Haakon, though he was outwardly his father's
image, did not resemble him in spirit. He was of a
conciliatory nature, amiable, and endowed with a
charm of manner which won him all hearts. It is
said that his foster-father had given him the counsel
at parting never to sit glum at the festal board, and
it is obvious that he took the lesson to heart. When
he landed in Tr&ouml;ndelag, people flocked about him,
and he won the chieftains for his cause by friendliness
and promises which he afterwards conscientiously
kept. He took part in the games of the
young, and in the serious discussions of the old,
excelled in all manly sports, and won admiration no
less by his beauty than by his intelligence and
generous disposition. The rumor of his arrival
spread like fire in withered grass, and people said
that old King Harold had come back once more to
his people, gentler and more generous than before,
but no less mighty and beautiful.</p>

<p>The first chieftain whose influence Haakon sought
to enlist in his behalf was the powerful Sigurd, Earl
of Hlade, who had been the friend and protector of
his mother, and the guardian of his infancy. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
earl received him well, and promised to support
his claims to the kingdom. With this view he called,
in Haakon's name, a great meeting of the peasants
in Tr&ouml;ndelag, and made a speech in which he denounced
the cruelty of Erik Blood-Axe and declared
his allegiance to Haakon. When the earl had
finished, Haakon arose and offered, in case the
peasants would make him their king, to restore to
them their allodium, of which his father had deprived
them. This announcement was received with
great rejoicing; and from all parts of the plain came
cries of homage and approval. Amid joyful tumult
Haakon was made king, and immediately started
southward with a large train of warriors. Wherever
he went, the people flocked about him and offered
him allegiance. The Oplands<a name="FNanchor_A_32" id="FNanchor_A_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_32" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> followed the example
of Tr&ouml;ndelag, and in Viken both chieftains and
peasants eagerly espoused his cause. As already
related, Erik made a desperate attempt to gather an
army, and, failing in this, fled with his family and a
few faithful followers to the Orkneys, and thence to
England.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_32" id="Footnote_A_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_32"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> See map.</p></div>

<p>It was consistent with Haakon's conciliatory disposition
that he did not molest or depose his
nephews, Gudr&ouml;d Bj&ouml;rnsson and Tryggve Olafsson,
but confirmed them as kings in Viken. It appears,
however, that, nominally at least, they recognized
his overlordship. Other sons and grandsons of
Harold the Fairhaired he met with the same friendliness,
giving to each what he considered to be his
due. As soon as peace was thus established, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>there was no one left to
dispute his power, Haakon
devoted himself energetically
to the improvement
of the internal administration
of his kingdom. He
divided the country into
<i>Thing-Unions</i>, or judicial
districts, and by the aid
of wise and experienced
men greatly improved the laws. One
famous code, called the Gulathings-law,
has particularly shed lustre upon
his name, and the enlargement and
improvement of the Frostathings-law
is also, by some of the sagas, attributed
to him. The only radical change
which he introduced was the breaking
up of his father's feudal state, by
the restoration of the allodium to the
peasants. But this one change necessitated
many others. When the king
relinquished his right to tax the land,
he thereby deprived himself of the
ability to keep an army, and had to
consign, in part, to the peasants
themselves the defence of their respective
districts. It was naturally
the sea-coast which was most exposed
to attack; and in the absence
of all but the most
primitive means of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>munication
it became possible for an enemy to
ravage long stretches of land, before the intelligence
of his presence reached the king. In order to
remedy this, Haakon ordered <i>varder</i> or signal-fires
to be lighted, at fixed intervals, all along the coast at
the approach of an enemy; but he partly counteracted
the good effect of the reform by the severe
punishment with which he threatened those who,
without adequate cause, lighted the <i>varder</i>. In
order to obtain the means to defend the coast, he
divided it into marine districts, each of which was
bound, on demand, to place a fully manned and
equipped ship of war at the disposal of the king.
This was, of course, but another form of taxation,
but was less distasteful to the peasants, because its
purpose and necessity were obvious, and no degrading
dependence was implied, since the people had
again become the free possessors of the soil. Nevertheless
there are indications that the personal tax,
derisively called the nose-tax, which had been introduced
by Harold, was continued, at least for a while,
by Haakon; as it is expressly stated that his first
ships of war were built by the income of the nose-tax.</p>

</div>

<p>Having arranged the military and judicial affairs
of his kingdom, Haakon turned his attention to a
matter which he had long had at heart. He had
been christened in his childhood in England, and
was an earnest votary of the Christian religion. But,
coming, as he did, to the kingdom of his father, not
as a conqueror, but as a candidate for the people's
favor, he did not venture at once to attack the
national faith. His friend, Earl Sigurd of Hlade,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was a fanatical adherent of the Asa-faith, and Haakon
might have counted on his enmity rather than his
support, if he had exhibited an ill-considered zeal for
the displacement of the old by
a new religion. Haakon, therefore,
temporized, and it was
not until the fifteenth or sixteenth
year of his reign (950-951),
when his unbonded popularity
seemed to warrant any
venture, that he took a decisive
step in behalf of Christianity.
He sent to England for a bishop and
a number of priests, and published a
decree, forbidding the people to sacrifice
to the old gods, and demanding
of them that they should accept the
faith in Christ. He called upon the
peasants to meet him at Drontheim,
where he repeated his demand. But
the peasants refused to declare themselves;
and begged the king to have
the matter legally settled at the
<i>Frosta-thing</i>. Here there was a great
concourse of people; and when the
assembly had been called to order,
Haakon rose and in an earnest and
dignified speech begged the
peasants to forsake the old
heathen gods who were but
wood and stone, and to believe in the one living God
and be baptized in His name. An ominous murmur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ran through the crowd at these words, and the peasant
Aasbj&ouml;rn of Medalhus arose and answered in
these words:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br />

</div>

<p>"When thou, King Haakon, didst call thy first
assembly here in Drontheim, and we took thee for
our king, we believed that heaven itself had descended
upon us; but now we do not know whether
it was liberty we gained, or whether thou wishest to
make us thralls once more, by thy strange demand
that we shall forsake the faith which our fathers and
all their forefathers have had before us. * * *
They were sturdier men than we are; and yet their
faith has done well enough for us. We have learned
to love thee well, and we have allowed thee to share
with us the administration of law and justice. Now,
we peasants have firmly determined and unanimously
agreed to keep the laws which thou didst propose
here at the <i>Frosta-thing</i>, and to which we gave our
assent. We all wish to follow thee, and to have thee
for our king, as long as a single one of us peasants is
alive&mdash;if only thou, king, wilt show moderation, and
not demand of us things in which we cannot follow
thee, and which it would be unseemly for us to do.
But if thou hast this matter so deeply at heart that
thou wilt try thy might and strength against ours,
then we have resolved to part from thee and take
another chieftain who will aid us in freely exercising
the religion which pleases us. Choose now, O king,
between these two conditions, before the assembly
has dispersed."</p>

</div>

<p>Loud shouts of approval greeted this speech; and
it was, for a while, impossible for any one to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
himself heard. At last, when the tempest had subsided,
Earl Sigurd of Hlade, probably after consultation
with Haakon, rose and said that the king would
yield to the wishes of the peasants and would not
part with their friendship. Encouraged by this first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
concession, the peasants now demanded that the
king should participate in their sacrifices and preside
at the sacrificial feast. Much against his will, Haakon
was again induced to yield, but tried to pacify his
conscience by making the sign of the cross over the
horn consecrated to Odin. During the following
year he was also compelled to eat horse-flesh at the
Yule-tide sacrifice, and to omit the sign of the cross
when drinking the toasts of the heathen gods. Full
of wrath he departed, intimating that he would soon
come back with an army large enough to punish
the Tr&ouml;nders for the humiliation they had put upon
him. There is little doubt that he would have carried
out this threat, if external enemies had not
directed his energies in another direction.</p>

<p>The sons of Erik Blood-Axe had, after their father's
death, sought refuge with King Harold Bluetooth in
Denmark. The two elder, Gamle and Guttorm, had
roamed about as vikings, ravaged the coasts of
Norway and the lands about the Baltic, while the
third son, Harold, was adopted by his namesake, the
Danish king, and received his education at his court.
They were all valiant warriors, but were much governed
by their shrewd and cruel mother, Gunhild.
They naturally cherished no good-will toward their
uncle Haakon, who had dispossessed them of their
kingdom; and while they were not yet strong
enough to wage regular war, they seized every opportunity
to annoy and harass him. They fought
many battles with Tryggve Olafsson, who, as king in
Viken, was charged with the defence of the southern
coast, and were sometimes victorious and sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
vanquished. In the year 952, when Tryggve was
absent, Haakon took occasion to deliver an effective
blow at the Danish vikings who were infesting this
part of the country (though the sons of Erik were
not this time among them), pursued them southward,
and harassed the coasts of Jutland and the
Danish isles. It appears, however, that this mode
of retaliation did not permanently discourage the
vikings, and as long as Harold Bluetooth showed
open hostility against Norway, by espousing the
cause of Gunhild and her sons, it is quite natural
that the warlike zeal and rapacity of the Danes
should be directed against the neighboring kingdom.
It is obvious, too, that Haakon, by his attack upon
Danish soil, gave a more personal character to the
animosity which the Danish king entertained toward
him, and Gunhild lost no time in profiting by this
change of feeling. From this time forth her sons appear
no longer as warlike adventurers, bent upon
private vengeance, but as commanders of fleets and
armies, and formidable pretenders to the Norwegian
throne. In 953 they defeated Tryggve Olafsson at
Sotoness, and compelled him to abandon his ships
and save himself by flight. When the news of this
disaster reached Haakon, he hastily made peace with
the Tr&ouml;nders who had forced him to sacrifice, and
called upon Earl Sigurd to aid him with all the
ships and men at his command. Earl Sigurd promptly
obeyed and sailed southward to meet the king.
At Agvaldsness they overtook the sons of Gunhild
and vanquished them in a hotly contested battle.
Haakon slew with his own hand his nephew Guttorm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Eriksson, and cut down his standard.
The surviving brothers
fled with the remnants of their
army to Denmark, and kept the
peace for two years. But in 955
they returned once more with a
largely increased force and surprised
King Haakon at Fraed&ouml;
in Nordm&ouml;re. The signal fires
had not been lighted, and no
intelligence of the presence of
the enemy had reached the king
until it was too late. He asked
his men whether they preferred
to stay and fight or avoid battle,
until they had gathered a sufficient
force. To this an old
peasant named Egil Uldsaerk
(Woolsark) made answer: "I
have been in many battles with
thy father, King Harold. Sometimes
he fought with a stronger
and sometimes with a weaker
foe. But he was always victorious.
Never have I heard him
ask counsel of his friends as to
whether he should run; nor will
we give thee such counsel. For
we think that we have in thee a
brave chieftain, and trusty aid
shalt thou receive from us."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">EGIL WOOLSARK&#39;S
MONUMENT OR BAUTASTONE AT FREINESS.</span>
</div>

<p>When the king praised these
words and declared himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ready to fight, Egil cried out joyously: "In this
long season of peace I have been afraid that I should
die of old age on the straw of my bed&mdash;I who
never asked any thing better than to follow my chieftain
and die in battle! Now, at last, I shall have
my wish fulfilled."</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">ORNAMENTAL BRONZE

</div>

<p>As soon as the sons of Erik had landed, the battle
commenced. They had six
men for every one of King
Haakon's. Seeing that the
odds were so heavily against
his lord, Egil Woolsark took
ten standard-bearers aside and
stole up a slope of land in
the rear of Gamle Eriksson's
battle-array. He made them
march with long intervals, so
that only the tops of their
standards could be seen above
the slope, and not the men
themselves. The Danes, spying
the waving banners, supposed
that a fresh force was
coming to cut them off from
their ships, and they raised a
great cry and fled. It was in vain that Gamle, who had
discovered the stratagem, shouted with a loud voice
commanding them to stay. Panic had seized them,
and their commander himself was swept away with
the hurrying mass, until he reached the beach, where
he made a final stand. Here Egil Woolsark attacked
him and received his death-wound after a desperate
conflict. Haakon too rushed in upon Gamle, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
defended himself bravely, but having received terrible
wounds, threw himself into the ocean and was
drowned. The other brothers swam to their ships
and returned to Denmark.</p>

<p>This victory secured peace to Norway for six
years. Haakon had thus an opportunity to resume
his efforts to Christianize the country. But his experience
of the peasants' temper had apparently
discouraged him. Personally he remained a Christian,
and induced many of his friends to forsake the
heathen faith. He lacked, however, the uncompromising
vigor and the burning zeal of a martyr and
propagandist. He preferred gentle to harsh measures,
and shrank from antagonizing those who had
been faithful to him in time of need. It is probable,
too, that the counsel of his friend, Earl Sigurd,
tended to cool his ardor, by emphasizing the political
phase of the religious question. The result of
this conciliatory policy, in connection with the good
crops which prevailed during his reign, was to make
King Haakon universally beloved. It is doubtful if
a king has ever sat upon the throne of Norway who
has been closer to the hearts of the people. Therefore,
as an expression of their affection for him, they
named him Haakon the Good.</p>

<p>In the twenty-sixth year of his reign (961) Haakon
was summering with his men-at-arms on his estate
Fitje in H&ouml;rdaland. A large number of guests were
with him, among whom the scald Eyvind Skaldespilder
(Scald-Spoiler),<a name="FNanchor_A_33" id="FNanchor_A_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_33" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who was on his mother's side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a great-grandson of Harold the Fairhaired. The
king was seated at the breakfast-table, when the
sentinels saw a large fleet of ships sailing in through
the fjord. They called the scald Eyvind aside,
and begged him to decide whether those were
not hostile ships. Eyvind sprang into the hall
where the king was sitting, and sang a verse, announcing
the approach of the sons of Erik. Haakon
arose and looked at the ships. Then he turned to
his men and said: "Here many ships are coming
against us, and our force is but small. It is plainly
to be seen that we shall have to fight against heavier
odds than ever before; for the sons of Gunhild
come with a larger force to-day than on previous
occasions. Loath I am to bring my best men into
too great a danger; and loath I am, too, to flee, unless
wise men decide that it would be foolhardy to await
the foe."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_33" id="Footnote_A_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_33"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Skaldespilder means waster or spoiler of scalds, because no
other scald could bear comparison with him.</p></div>

<p>Eyvind Scald-Spoiler replied in verse that it would
ill befit a man like King Haakon to flee from the
sons of Gunhild. "Manly speech is that, and in
accordance with my mind," answered the king; and
when the other warriors with one accord clamored
for battle, he put on his armor, buckled his sword
about his loins, and seized spear and shield. On his
head he wore a golden helmet which flashed in the
sun. Beautiful he was to behold, with his mild and
noble countenance, and his bright hair streaming
down over his shoulders. Upon the fields without
he arranged his men in battle array, and raised
his standards. The sons of Erik disembarked
with a large army, commanded by the third of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the brothers, Harold, and his two uncles, Eyvind
Skreyja and Alf Askman. The battle which now
commenced was wild and bloody. The army of the
sons of Gunhild was six times as numerous as that
of King Haakon. But Haakon, knowing his Norsemen
well, did not lose heart. Wherever the fight
was hottest, there flashed his golden helmet. He
joked with Eyvind, the scald, when he passed him,
and improvised a verse in reply to the one with
which he was greeted. The fiercer the conflict grew,
the higher rose the king's spirits. At last, when the
heat oppressed him, he flung away his armor and
stormed forward at the head of his men. The supply
of spears and arrows soon ran short, and the
hostile ranks clashed together and fought, hand to
hand, with their swords. The shining helmet made
the king very conspicuous, and Eyvind Scald-Spoiler
noticed that it served as a target for the Danish
spears. He therefore took a hood and pulled it
over the helmet. Eyvind Skreyja, who was just
rushing forward to meet the king, thereby lost sight
of him, and he cried out: "What has become of the
king of the Norsemen? Does he hide himself, or is
he afraid? No more do I see the golden helmet?"
"Keep on as thou art steering, if thou wishest to find
the king of the Norsemen," shouted Haakon, and
throwing away his shield, seized his sword with both
hands, and sprang forward where all could see him.
Eyvind Skreyja bounded forward with uplifted
sword, but one of the king's men caught the blow
upon his shield, and in the same instant Haakor,
cleft Eyvind's head and neck down to the shoul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ders.
The example of their king fired the Norsemen's
courage, while the fall of their greatest
champion brought confusion to the Danes. The
former charged with renewed fury, while the latter
were pressed down to the beach, and leaped into the
ocean; many were killed or drowned, but a few, including
Harold Eriksson, saved themselves by
swimming, and were picked up by the ships. While
pursuing the fleeing foe, Haakon was hit in his right
arm by a peculiarly shaped arrow, and all efforts to
staunch the blood proved in vain. It was said that
Gunhild had bewitched this arrow and given it to
her chamberlain, with the charge that he should
shoot it off against King Haakon. As night approached,
the king grew weaker and weaker, and
fainted repeatedly. One of his friends offered to
take his body over to England, when he was dead,
so that he might be buried in Christian soil. But
Haakon replied: "I am not worthy of it. I have
lived like a heathen, and therefore it is meet that I
should be buried like a heathen."</p>

<p>Thus died Haakon the Good and, as the saga says,
was mourned alike by friends and foes. His last act
before dying was to send a ship after the sons of
Gunhild, and beg them to come back and take the
kingdom; for he had himself no sons, and his only
daughter, Thora, could not, according to the law,
succeed to the throne.</p>

<p>Eyvind Scald-Spoiler made a song in King Haakon's
honor, called <i>Haakonarmaal</i>, in which he
praised his virtues and described his reception in
Valhalla.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>HAROLD GRAYFELL AND HIS BROTHERS (961-970).</h3>


<p>The sons of Gunhild lost no time in taking possession
of the kingdom of their fathers. It was not,
however, the entire Norway to which they succeeded,
but only the middle districts. In Viken, Tryggve
Olafsson and Gudr&ouml;d Bj&ouml;rnsson, both grandsons of
Harold the Fairhaired, ruled as independent kings,
and in Tr&ouml;ndelag Earl Sigurd, of Hlade, refused to
acknowledge the supremacy of the race of Erik
Blood-Axe. Undoubtedly the brothers were only
biding their time until they should be strong enough
to punish these contemptuous rebels; but so bitter
was the feeling against them, even in the provinces
which they nominally ruled, that they had all they
could do in maintaining their authority within the
narrow limits which had from the beginning been assigned
to them. One of the chief causes of their
unpopularity was their dependence upon the Danish
king, by whose aid they had gained the kingdom,
and to whom they apparently stood in a relation of
vassalage. As a consequence of this, they took no
pains to gain the favor of the Norwegian people,
but surrounded themselves with a great throng of
Danish warriors who constituted their court and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>main-stay of their strength. Very unfortunate, too,
was the influence which their mother Gunhild exercised
over them. Scarcely had she returned to Norway,
when she resumed her baneful activity, egging
her sons on to cruel and treacherous deeds, by which
they forfeited the people's respect and undermined
their own power. Misfortune had not taught her
caution, nor had age softened the fierce malignity of
her temper.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">CHURCH AT EGIL&Ouml;, OR EGIL&#39;S ISLAND (ONE OF THE ORKNEYS); SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN BUILT BEFORE THE
VIKING AGE.</span>
</div>

<p>The oldest surviving brother, Harold, surnamed
Graafeld (Grayfell) resembled, in appearance his
father, Erik Blood-Axe. He was haughty, avaricious,
and revengeful; tall of stature, finely built, and of
lordly presence, but for all that a weak and vacillating
character. He lacked entirely that kindliness
and <i>bonhommie</i> which had made his uncle Haakon
the Good beloved of all the people. Of the other
brothers we have no definite knowledge; they
seem, however, all to have inherited their share of
the traits which made their parents odious. Two
of them, Gudr&ouml;d and Sigurd Sleva, proved themselves
worthy sons of the malicious Gunhild. The
others are usually spoken of collectively, and their
names are variously given.</p>

<p>It may have been the sense of his unpopularity
which induced Harold Grayfell to make overtures to
the former courtiers of King Haakon. Several of
them, it appears, entered his service, but felt themselves
ill at ease among the foreign warriors who
enjoyed his favor and confidence. Jealousies and
petty bickerings were the order of the day; every
allusion to King Haakon's virtues gave offence, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
when the song of Eyvind Scald-Spoiler, praising his
former lord, reached the king's ears, he exclaimed
angrily: "You love King Haakon yet, and it is best
that you follow him and become his men."</p>

<p>The men then departed, not suddenly, but one by
one, and made the names of the sons of Gunhild
still more detested throughout the land. Eyvind
Scald-Spoiler in a noble verse refused to be King
Harold's court poet, and after his departure made a
song in which he compared Haakon with Harold,
much to the latter's disadvantage. There was in
that year (962) a great dearth of food in the land;
crops and fisheries failed, and the cattle had to
be fed with leaf-buds instead of grass. In some districts
snow fell in the middle of summer. The
people who believed that the gods had sent these
evil times because of their anger at the kings, gave
vent to their discontent in loud murmuring. Harold
Grayfell and his brothers, it appears, had been baptized
in their youth in England and were nominally
Christians. They refrained from sacrificing, and
broke down and destroyed many heathen temples.
But they made no effort to enlighten the people regarding
the new religion; and probably considered
questions of faith as being of small moment. Surrounded,
as they were, by enemies on all sides, their
first ambition was naturally to re-conquer the kingdom
which Harold the Fairhaired had bequeathed
to their father. It became, therefore, a political
necessity to break the power of Earl Sigurd of Hlade,
as well as of Tryggve Olafsson and Gudr&ouml;d Bj&ouml;rnsson
in Viken. To do this in open warfare was out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of the question; and Gunhild, therefore, persuaded
her sons to resort to treachery. By flattery and
promises, Harold bribed Grjotgard Haakonsson, a
younger brother of Earl Sigurd, to send him word
when a favorable opportunity should present itself
for killing the earl. At the same time the king sent
messengers with gifts and friendly assurances to the
intended victim, but failed for awhile to lead him
into any trap. At last, when these repeated protestations
of friendship had, perhaps, made him relax
his vigilance, Harold Grayfell and his brother Erling,
having received notice from Grjotgard, surprised
the earl in the night, while he was away from home,
and burned him and all his retinue. By this deed,
however, they raised up against themselves an enemy
who proved more dangerous to them than the one they
had slain. Earl Sigurd's son, Haakon, was twenty-five
years old, when his father died, and a man splendidly
equipped in body and mind. He was a great
warrior, handsome in person, sagacious, resolute, and
friendly and affable in his demeanor. His family was,
in some respect, as good as any king's; for he belonged
to the old tribal aristocracy which had maintained
its authority in Tr&ouml;ndelag from the earliest
Germanic times. When he was born, King Haakon
the Good, who happened just then to be his father's
guest, had poured water upon his head and given him
his own name.</p>

<p>When the intelligence of Earl Sigurd's death
reached him, Haakon called the Tr&ouml;nders together,
and a great multitude responded to his summons.
They clamored for vengeance upon the treacherous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
sons of Gunhild, confirmed Haakon in the dignity
which his father had possessed, and declared themselves
ready to follow him. With a great fleet he
sailed out of the Drontheim fiord; but the sons of
Gunhild fled southward and did not venture to give
battle. The Tr&ouml;nders, having given their allegiance
to Earl Haakon, refused to pay taxes to Harold
Grayfell, who, after some indecisive fights, was compelled
virtually to recognize his rival's independence.
Haakon, however, was well aware what such a concession
must have cost the haughty king, and he
knew, too, that his independence would last only so
long as he was able to defend it. With a view to
strengthening his position, he therefore formed an
alliance with the two kings in Viken, which only had
the effect of speedily bringing down upon the latter
the vengeance of Gunhild's sons. Harold Grayfell
and his brother Gudr&ouml;d made a pretence of quarrelling,
and feigned a furious hostility to each other.
A viking cruise which they were about to undertake
together was accordingly deferred, and Gudr&ouml;d,
complaining of his brother's conduct, sent a friendly
message to Tryggve Olafsson, begging him to accompany
him on his cruise. Tryggve accepted the invitation,
and on arriving at the appointed place
of meeting was foully murdered with all his men.
King Gudr&ouml;d Bj&ouml;rnsson (the son of Bj&ouml;rn the
Merchant) was about the same time surprised at
a banquet by Harold Grayfell, and slain after a
desperate resistance. After these exploits, Harold
and Gudr&ouml;d re-united and took possession of Viken.
They hastened to King Tryggve's dwelling in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
hope of exterminating his whole race. But Tryggve's
widow, Aastrid, anticipating their intention,
had fled with her foster-father,
Thorolf Luse-skjegg, (Lousy-Beard),
and a few attendants.
She was then with child, and
on a little islet in the Rand's
fiord, where she was hiding, she
bore her son Olaf Tryggvesson.
Wherever she went Gunhild's
spies pursued her. Hearing that
she had borne a son, the wily
queen spared no effort to get
her in her power. During the
entire summer Aastrid was compelled
to remain on the solitary
islet, venturing out only in the
night, and hiding among the
underbrush in the daytime.
When toward autumn the nights
began to grow darker, she went
ashore with her attendants, travelling
only when the darkness
protected them. After many
hardships she reached her father
Erik Ofrestad's estate in the
Oplands; but even here the wily
Gunhild left her no peace. A
man named Haakon was despatched
with thirty armed attendants
to search for her and her child; but Erik of
Ofrestad got news of their mission in time to send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
his daughter and grandson away. Disguised as beggars,
Aastrid and Thoralf Lousy-Beard travelled on
foot from farm to farm, and came toward evening to
the house of a man named Bj&ouml;rn. They asked for
food and shelter, but were rudely driven away by the
inhospitable peasant. At a neighboring farm, however,
they were kindly received by a peasant named
Thorstein. Gunhild's emissaries, having searched
in vain at Ofrestad, got on the track of the fugitives,
and learned at the house of Bj&ouml;rn that a handsome
woman in poor attire, bearing a babe in her arms,
had applied for shelter early in the evening. This
conversation one of Thorstein's servants happened
to overhear, and on arriving home, related it to his
master. Thorstein immediately, with loud chiding
and pretended wrath, roused the supposed beggars
from their sleep, and drove them out into the night.
This he did in order to deceive the servants and
other listeners. But when Aastrid and Thoralf were
well under way, he told them that Gunhild's hired
assassins had arrived at the neighboring farm, and
that his only desire was to save them. He also gave
them a trusted attendant who could show them the
best hiding-places in the forest. At the shores of a
lake they concealed themselves among the tall bulrushes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

ARROW-HEADS OF IRON." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">SCISSORS AND
ARROW-HEADS OF IRON.</span>
</div>

<p>Thorstein, in the meanwhile, sent their pursuers
in the opposite direction, and led them a dance
through forest and field in a vain search for the fugitives.
The next night, when Haakon and his men
had given up the search, he sent food and clothes to
Aastrid, and furnished her with an escort to Sweden,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
where she found a place of refuge with a friend of
her father's named Haakon the Old. Gunhild, however,
was not to be discouraged. She sent two embassies
to King Erik of Sweden, demanding the
surrender of Olaf Tryggvesson, and received each
time permission to capture the child, without interference
on the part of the king. But Haakon the
Old was a mighty man, and determined to defend his
guests. The threats of Gunhild's embassador did
not frighten him. While the latter was speaking, a
half-witted thrall, named Buste, seized a dung-fork,
and rushed at him, threatening to strike. The embassador,
fearing to be soiled, took to his heels, and
was pursued by the thrall. How the queen received
him on his return is not recorded.</p>

<p>Of the internal enemies of Gunhild's sons, Earl
Haakon of Hlade now alone remained; and it was not
an unnatural desire on their part to reduce him to
subjection. Anticipating, as usual, their action, the
earl was on the look-out for them; but having ascertained
the size of their fleets, he saw the hopelessness
of his cause, and forthwith sailed to Denmark,
where he was well received by King Harold Bluetooth
(964). It will thus be seen that the friendship
between Harold Grayfell and the Danish king had
not endured the strain of diverging interests. The
former, as soon as he felt secure in his power, refused
to recognize the latter's claim to Viken, and paid
him no taxes. Harold Bluetooth, therefore, allied
himself with Earl Haakon, the bitterest enemy of
the sons of Gunhild, hoping, by his aid, to regain his
lost dominion. What particularly encouraged him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in this expectation was the continued dearth which
prevailed in Norway, and the resulting unpopularity
of the kings which, with every year, grew more pronounced.
It was of no avail that Harold Grayfell
almost every summer went on viking cruises, gaining
a great fame as a warrior and bringing home
rich treasures. The people hated him only less than
they hated his mother Gunhild. An exploit of his
brother Sigurd Sleva aroused a demonstration of
wrath which came near culminating in open rebellion.
Sigurd Sleva had paid a visit to a mighty yeoman
named Klypp Thorsson, and had, in the absence of
the master of the house, been hospitably received by
his beautiful wife Aaluf. He had become enamoured
of his hostess, and had grievously insulted
her. Klypp, on his return, learned what had occurred;
and swore to avenge the shame which had
been brought upon him by Gunhild's son. When
Harold Grayfell and Sigurd, in the autumn of 964,
held a <i>thing</i> at Vors, they were attacked by the enraged
peasants, and had to save themselves by flight.
Klypp, with a number of his friends, pursued Sigurd,
slew him with his own hand, and was himself slain
by one of Sigurd's men.</p>

<p>Earl Haakon, who, from his Danish retreat,
watched the events in Norway, heard these tidings
with satisfaction. The sudden check which his ambition
had received had made him ill, and for some
time he appeared listless, refusing to eat and drink,
or to communicate with anybody. But when his
plans of vengeance were matured, he rose from his
bed, strode forth with his old vigor, and proceeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to weave a complicated net of intrigues. Harold
Bluetooth had at that time a difficulty with his
nephew Gold-Harold, who demanded a share in the
government; and, having confidence in the sagacity
of the earl, he asked his advice. The earl saw here
his opportunity, and had no scruple in availing himself
of it. He dissuaded the king from killing his
nephew, because such a deed would arouse indignation
and alienate the great party in Denmark, who
desired to see Gold-Harold on the throne. Far
better would it be if he employed Gold-Harold to
punish Harold Grayfell and his brothers, and in the
end reward him with the throne of Norway. Thereby
the king would increase his own power, and convert
a dangerous rival into a friend and ally. This
advice seemed good to Harold Bluetooth, and after
some persuasion he found courage to act upon it.
He sent a friendly message to his foster-son, Harold
Grayfell, inviting him to come and take possession
of his old fief in Denmark, the income of which he
might, indeed, need during the hard times that prevailed
in Norway. Harold Grayfell, after some
vacillation, accepted this invitation, and sailed to
Denmark with three ships and two hundred and
forty men; but no sooner had he set foot upon
Danish soil than he was attacked by Gold-Harold,
who slew him and nearly all his men.</p>

<p>This was the first act in the drama which Earl
Haakon had planned. The second contained a surprise.
The earl went to Harold Bluetooth, and
represented to him that his nephew, as king of Norway,
would become a more dangerous rival than he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
had been before; and frankly offered to kill him, if
the king would promise not to avenge his death.
Furthermore, he demanded, as his reward, the kingdom
of Norway in fief, under the overlordship of
the king. All this seemed very tempting to Harold
Bluetooth; and like all weak and vicious men, he
made objections only for the purpose of having them
overcome. In the end he gave his consent; and
Gold-Harold was immediately attacked and killed
by Earl Haakon. With a large army the two conspirators
now sailed for Norway, and won the whole
country without striking a blow. So great was the
hatred of Gunhild and her sons, that not a man
drew his sword in their defence. The two surviving
brothers, Gudr&ouml;d and Ragnfred, made a pretence of
resistance, rallying a few followers about them; but
did not venture to give battle. Seeing the hopelessness
of their cause, they fled with their mother to the
Orkneys (965). Ragnfred, however, returned the following
year with a considerable fleet, largely made
up of vikings who had gathered about him, and
fought an indicisive battle with Earl Haakon. He
even succeeded in reconquering four of the northwestern
shires. For nearly a year Haakon made no
effort to expel him. It was not until the spring of
967, that he felt himself strong enough to appeal to
arms once more; and this time Ragnfred and his
brother Gudr&ouml;d, who in the meantime had joined
him, were defeated at Dingeness, and driven into
exile. According to the most reliable accounts, they
went to Scotland, but continued for several years to
harass the coast of Norway by sudden attacks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
They were, however, no longer sufficiently formidable
to cause the earl any serious inconvenience, although
he was not slow to seize upon their attacks
as a pretext for discontinuing the payment of the
tax which he had pledged to the Danish king.
Gunhild died, in all probability, either in Scotland
or the Orkneys, although one of the sagas relates,
that she was enticed to Denmark by Harold Bluetooth,
under promise of marriage, and at his command
drowned in a swamp</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>EARL HAAKON (970-995).</h3>


<p>By his daring intrigue Earl Haakon had attained
the goal of his desires. He had avenged his father's
death, humiliated his enemies, and gained a power
far beyond that of any of his ancestors. With a
nature like his, however, no goal is final. The ease
with which he had managed Harold Bluetooth and
his nephew&mdash;using them as tools for his own ends&mdash;had,
no doubt, inspired him with a supreme confidence
in his ability, and a corresponding contempt
of those whose shrewdness was inferior to his own.
The purpose therefore soon matured in his mind to
repudiate his obligations to the Danish king, and
make himself the independent ruler of Norway. The
opportunity for carrying this purpose into effect
soon presented itself. The Emperor Otto I. of Germany,
who claimed sovereignty over Denmark, died
in 973, and was succeeded by his young son, Otto
II. Harold Bluetooth, who had always resented the
emperor's claim, even though he was forced to
recognize it, made extensive preparations for a campaign
against Otto II., and sent messengers to his
vassal, Earl Haakon, commanding him to come to
his aid with all the forces at his disposal. Earl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Haakon, whatever his inclinations may have been,
did not deem it advisable to disobey, and in the
spring of the year 975 sailed southward with a large
fleet and army. He did duty for a while in defending
the wall of Dannevirke, and actually beat the
emperor in a great battle. Then, feeling that his
task had been accomplished, he boarded his ships
and prepared to sail homeward. The emperor, however,
hearing that Dannevirke was deserted by its
defenders, returned for a second attack, and forced his
way into Jutland. Whether Harold Bluetooth fought
with him does not appear. We only know that he
accepted a humiliating peace, reaffirming his vassalage,
and, according to a creditable source, promising
to introduce the Christian religion, both in his own
kingdom and in Norway. It is probable that both
Harold and his son, Sweyn Forkbeard, had been baptized
before, but continued in their hearts to be devoted
to the Asa faith. It was scarcely zeal for
Christianity, but fear of the emperor, which induced
Harold to send for Earl Haakon and force him to
accept baptism and to promise to convert his countrymen
to the new religion. It is strange that a man
as shrewd as Haakon, after his recent desertion of
Dannevirke, should have obeyed this summons. In
all likelihood the victorious battle which he had
fought gave him confidence in his power to justify
himself; and there may also have been circumstances
connected with the affair which changed its aspect
to contemporaries. It is not inconceivable, however,
that he really wished for a plausible pretext for
rebellion, and deliberately took his chances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus145.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="HAROLD BLUETOOTH." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">HAROLD BLUETOOTH.</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>With a ship-load of priests Haakon departed from
this fateful meeting with the Danish king. But no
sooner was he out of Harold's sight, than he put his
priests ashore, and began to harry on both sides of
the Sound. On the rocky cliffs of Gautland he made
a grand sacrificial feast, to counteract the effect of
his recent baptism, and stood watching for a response
from the old gods, that they looked upon
him with favor, and would give him success in the
war he was about to undertake. Then two ravens
came and followed his ships, "clucking" loudly. The
ravens were the birds of Odin, and Haakon saw in
their flight a happy augury. A warlike fury seems
now to have possessed him. With a recklessness
which in so prudent a man is inconceivable (except
under high religious excitement), he burned his ships,
landed with his army on the coast of Sweden, and
marched northward, ravaging the land with fire and
sword. A broad track of blood and desolation followed
his destructive progress. Even in the Norwegian
province Viken, which Harold Bluetooth had
given to Sweyn Forkbeard, he continued his devastations
in pure wantonness, as if to advertise his defiance
of the Danish king and all that belonged to him.
From Viken he took his way overland to Drontheim,
where he henceforth lived as an independent sovereign;
though for some reason he refrained from assuming
the royal title.</p>

<p>It was probably some time before Harold Bluetooth
could raise an army strong enough to pursue
the earl and defeat him in his own stronghold.
There is some doubt, however, whether his campaign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to Norway, for the purpose of punishing his rebellious
vassal, took place in 976 or two or three years later.
Following Haakon's example, he laid the land waste,
killing and burning every thing in his path. In
Laerdal in Sogn, he left only five houses unburned.
When, however, Earl Haakon sailed southward to
meet him with a numerous fleet, the king suddenly
lost his courage, set sail, and made for home. It is
said that Harold Bluetooth had on that occasion no
less than twelve hundred ships.</p>

<p>Earl Haakon had now peace for some years. He
had, as soon as he had conquered the sons of Gunhild,
married the beautiful Thora, daughter of the
powerful chieftain Skage Skoftesson: and had by
her two sons, Sweyn and Heming, and a daughter,
Bergljot. Considerably older than these children,
was the earl's illegitimate son, Erik, who, according
to one account, was born when his father was but
fifteen years old. There is, however, good reason
for questioning this statement. Erik was a stubborn
and turbulent youth, who could not be induced to
respect the authority of his father. When he was
ten or eleven years old, he got into a dispute with
Haakon's brother-in-law Tiding-Skofte, about the
right to anchor his ship next to the earl's. Tiding-Skofte,
who was a great favorite of the earl's, had
been especially granted this privilege and was inclined
to insist upon it. To avenge this insult Erik
watched his chance and slew him a year later. He
thereby incurred the hostility of his father, and fled
to Viken, where Sweyn Forkbeard gave him a cordial
reception.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>It was scarcely to be expected that Harold Bluetooth
should quietly accept the humiliation which
Earl Haakon had put upon him. He was, indeed,
getting too old himself to measure strength again
with his powerful antagonist; and he therefore delegated
the task of punishing him to his friends and
allies. Among the latter were the celebrated Jomsvikings,
who lived at Jomsborg, on the island of
Wollin, at the mouth of the river Oder. These
vikings were a well-disciplined company of pirates,
who made war their exclusive business, living by
rapine and plunder. They were bound by very strict
laws to obey their chief, to spurn death and danger,
to aid each other, and to endure pain uncomplainingly.
Like the Italian condottieri, they were willing
to serve any master with whom their chief could
make satisfactory arrangements. For women they
professed contempt, and no woman was permitted
to enter their burgh. These formidable marauders
Harold Bluetooth endeavored to stir up against his
rebellious vassal. At a funeral feast which their
chief, Earl Sigvalde, made in honor of his father, a
great throng of warriors were present; the ale and
mead flowed abundantly, and there was much good
cheer in the hall. When Earl Sigvalde rose to drink
the toast to Brage, he vowed that before three
winters were past he would kill Earl Haakon or expel
him from his realm, or himself die in the attempt.
The other vikings, not wishing to be outdone by
their chief, made vows scarcely less daring; and the
enthusiasm rose to such a pitch that no achievement
seemed beyond their strength. When they woke up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the next morning, the affair wore a
slightly different aspect; but having
once promised, they could not retreat.
So they made a virtue of necessity,
and prepared in haste
for the attack. The rumor
of their vows had, however,
preceded them, and reached
Erik, the son of Earl Haakon.
Disregarding his father's
hostility, he hurried
northward to Drontheim with
all the men he could gather,
and placed them at the disposal
of the earl. The Jomsvikings,
in the meanwhile,
occupied themselves in plundering
the coasts of Norway,
sailing slowly northward with
a well-manned fleet of sixty
ships. The number of their
warriors was between seven
and eight thousand. They
met Earl Haakon and his
sons Erik, Sweyn, Sigurd,
and Erling at Hj&ouml;rungavaag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in S&ouml;ndm&ouml;re. The earl had one hundred and eighty
ships, the majority of which were inferior in size and
equipment to those of his enemies; and according to
a probable calculation, his force amounted to ten or
eleven thousand men. So many men and ships had
scarcely ever before been seen together in the North,
and the sagas relate that the fight in Hj&ouml;rungavaag
(986) was the greatest battle that has ever been fought
in Norway.</p>

</div>

<p>As Earl Haakon saw the first of the Jomsvikings
sailing up the sound, he disposed his own ships in
battle-array. He gave his oldest son Erik command
of the right wing, placed Sweyn on the left, and
himself commanded the centre. Opposite to Sweyn
were the ships of the famous Jomsviking Vagn
Aakesson, whose impetuosity and daring had made
him dreaded far and wide. The young Earl Sweyn
was no match for such an antagonist, and after a gallant
resistance he began to retreat. His brother
Erik, seeing the imminent danger, rowed around to
his wing, drove Vagn back, and forced his brother
to resume his position. Then he hastened back to
his own wing, and came just in time to check the
progress of Bue the Big (Digre), who commanded
the corresponding wing of the Jomsvikings. The
battle now grew furious, and the carnage on both
sides was tremendous. The spears and arrows fell
in rattling showers about Earl Haakon, as he stood
in the prow of his ship, and so many hit him that his
shirt of mail was torn into strips, and he was forced to
throw it away. The ships of the vikings were higher
than those of the Norsemen, and the advantage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
which this afforded the former told at first heavily
against the latter. Then, it is told, Earl Haakon
suddenly disappeared, and the legend relates that he
took his youngest son Erling, went ashore with him,
and sacrificed him to the gods for victory. Instantly
the skies grew black, and a violent hail-storm beat
down, pelting the faces of the Jomsvikings and almost
blinding them. Every grain of hail, says the
saga, weighed two ounces. Some even declared that
they saw the maidens of Odin, the Valkyrias,
Thorgerd and Irp, standing in the prow of Earl
Haakon's ship, sending forth a deadlier hail of unerring
arrows. The Jomsvikings fought half blindly,
fell on the slippery decks in a slush of blood and
melting hail, but in spite of the twilight and confusion
yet held their own. Then suddenly their
chief, Earl Sigvalde, turned and fled. Vagn Aakesson,
who saw him, cried out in a frenzy of rage: "Why
dost thou flee, thou evil hound, and leave thy men in
the lurch? That shame shall cling to thee all thy days."
Earl Sigvalde made no reply; and it was well for
him that he did not; for in the same instant a spear
was hurled forth from Vagn's hand, transfixing the
man at the helm. A moment before Vagn had seen
his chieftain there, and it was for him the spear was
intended. Confusion now became general; and all
Earl Sigvalde's men, seeing that his standard was
gone, fell out of line and fled. At last only Vagn
Aakesson and Bue the Big were left. Earl Haakon
pulled up alongside the ship of the latter and a combat
ensued, which, in wildness and fury, has scarcely
a parallel in the records of the sagas. Two great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
champions of the Jomsvikings, Haavard the Hewer
(Huggende) and Aslak Rock-skull (Holmskalle),
vaulted over the gunwale of the earl's ship and
made tremendous havoc, until an Icelander seized an
anvil which was used for sharpening the weapons
and dashed it against Aslak's head, splitting his
skull. Haavard had both his feet cut off, but fought
on furiously, standing on his knees. The spears
whizzed about the earl's ears and the arrows flew
past him with their angry twang. His men fell and
the Jomsvikings were pressing forward. Then, in
the nick of time, came his son Erik, and, with a
throng of his men, boarded the galley of Bue the
Big. In their first onset Bue received a terrible cut
across the nose. "Now," he cried, "I fear the
Danish maidens will no more kiss me." Then,
seeing that resistance was vain, he seized two chests
full of gold and shouted: "Overboard all Bue's
men," and leaped into the sea. Vagn Aakesson's
galley was likewise boarded, and there was a repetition
of former scenes of carnage. When all but
thirty of his men were dead he at last surrendered.
The captives were brought ashore and ordered to sit
down in a row upon a long log. Their feet were tied
together with a rope, while their hands remained
free. One of Earl Erik's men, Thorkell Leira, whom
Vagn at that memorable funeral feast had promised
to kill, was granted the privilege to reciprocate the
intended favor toward Vagn. With his axe uplifted
he rushed at the captives, and, beginning at one end
of the log, struck off one head after another. He
meant to keep Vagn until the last, in order to in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>crease
his agony. But Vagn sat chatting merrily
with his men; and there was much joking and
laughter.</p>

<p>"We have often disputed," said one, "as to
whether a man knows of any thing when his head is
off. That we can now test, for if I am conscious,
after having lost my head, I will stick my knife into
the earth."</p>

<p>When his turn came all sat watching with interest.
But his knife fell from his nerveless grasp, and there
was no trace of consciousness. One of the vikings
on the log seemed particularly in excellent spirits.
He laughed and sang, as he saw the bloody heads of
his comrades rolling about his feet. Just at that
moment Earl Erik approached and asked him if he
would like to live.</p>

<p>"That depends," answered the viking, "upon who
it is who offers me life."</p>

<p>"He offers who has the power to do it," said the
earl; "Earl Erik himself."</p>

<p>"Then I gladly accept," the viking replied.</p>

<p>The next in order, as the executioner walked up
to him, made an equivocal pun, which, however,
pleased Earl Erik so well that he set him free.
Eighteen had now been beheaded and two pardoned.
The twenty-first was a very young man with long,
beautiful hair and a handsome countenance. As
Thorkell Leira paused before him he twisted his hair
into a coil and begged him not to soil it with his
blood. In order to humor him, Thorkell told one of
the bystanders to take hold of the coil while he
struck off the head. The man consented; but just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as the axe was descending, the Jomsviking pulled
his head violently back, and the obliging assistant
had both his hands cut off.</p>

<p>"Some of the Jomsvikings are alive yet," he cried,
as he raised his head laughing.</p>

<p>Earl Erik, who had witnessed this scene, asked
him his name.</p>

<p>"I am said to be a son of Bue," he answered.</p>

<p>"Very likely is that," said the earl; "do you wish
to live?"</p>

<p>"What other choice have I?" asked the young
viking.</p>

<p>When Thorkell Leira observed that Earl Erik was
in a forgiving mood, he grew very wroth. Fearing
that he might be thwarted in his vengeance on Vagn
Aakesson, he sprang past the remaining men and,
with his axe raised above his head, rushed toward
his enemy. One of the men on the log, however,
seeing his chief's danger, flung himself forward so
that Thorkell stumbled over his body and dropped
his axe. Instantly Vagn was on his feet, seized the
axe and dealt Thorkell such a blow that the axe
went through the neck, and the blade was buried in
the earth. Thus Vagn Aakesson was the only one
of the Jomsvikings who accomplished what he had
vowed to do. Earl Erik, full of admiration of his
feat, now had his bonds removed and gave him his
liberty. The other prisoners who were yet alive
were also set free at the earl's command.</p>

<p>Not far from the spot where this occurred sat Earl
Haakon with many of his chieftains. Suddenly the
loud twang of a bow-string was heard, and in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
same instant Gissur the White, from Valders, who
sat next to the earl and was more magnificently
dressed than he, fell dead, pierced by an arrow.
Many men hastened down to the ship whence the
arrow had come, and found Haavard the Hewer,
who, half dazed with loss of blood, stood on his
knees with his bow in his hands. "Tell me, lads,"
he said, "did any one fall over there at the tree?"</p>

<p>He was told that Gissur the White had fallen.</p>

<p>"Then I was not so much in luck as I had hoped,"
he remarked; "for that arrow was meant for the
earl."</p>

<p>It was plain that the favorable result of this great
battle was due chiefly to the intrepidity and circumspection
of Earl Erik. His father would perhaps
have recognized this fact, if the son had not apparently
superseded his authority in sparing the life of
so important a man as Vagn Aakesson without consultation
with the commander-in-chief. He did not,
however, venture to disregard Earl Erik's pardon,
but loudly expressed his discontent, and parted from
his son in anger. Vagn followed his rescuer southward,
and became his familiar friend and companion.</p>

<p>Earl Haakon's power was now so well confirmed
that no one ventured to dispute his supremacy.
Crops and fisheries were good. The people enjoyed
many years of peace and contentment. The earls of
the Orkneys paid Haakon tribute, as if he had been
a king, and a king he was in every thing except the
name. His family had always been associated with
the ancient temple and earldom of Hlade; and it was a
matter of pride with him to retain his ancestral dig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>nity.
This is significant when we consider how he
was in all things a man of the old dispensation. At
a time when heathenism was slowly crumbling away,
and the faith in the old gods was losing its hold upon
the upper classes, Haakon was a devout and sincere
heathen. The continual intercourse of Norway with
England and the lands of the South had half imperceptibly
weakened the old superstitions and made the
legends of Odin and Thor appear to many like nursery
tales which grown-up men could scarcely be expected
to believe. Repudiation of all supernaturalism
and a proud reliance upon his own good sword was
at this time characteristic of the Norse viking, who
prided himself upon his knowledge of the world and
his deeds in distant lands. For all that the Asa faith
as later events will prove, had yet a sufficient number
of sincere believers to make the progress of the
new faith slow and sanguinary. Nevertheless so
atrocious an act as the sacrifice of one's own child
could not have failed to arouse indignation even
among the worshippers of Odin and Thor. Such
horrors were tolerated far back in the gloom of primeval
antiquity, but must have been felt in the
tenth century as a hideous anachronism. How
much Earl Haakon's heathen fanaticism contributed
to his downfall is difficult to determine. The
sacrifice of Erling during the battle with the
Jomsvikings, though it was generally regarded as a
fact, was not the original cause of the rebellion
which cost the earl his throne and his life. The
vices by which he forfeited his early popularity were
of a kind which assert their sway over men, irrespective
of religions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 995 Earl Haakon was travelling in
Gauldale, collecting taxes. His son Erlend, of whom
he was very fond, lay with some ships out in the
fiord, waiting to receive the treasure. One evening
the earl sent a company of thralls to the house of
the powerful peasant Brynjulf, commanding him to
send him his wife, who was renowned for her beauty.
Brynjulf refused, and the earl in great anger sent
the thralls back with this message to the indignant
husband, that he had the choice between death
and the surrender of his wife. The peasant was
obliged to yield, and with a heavy heart let his wife
depart with the thralls. But no sooner was she
gone than he recovered his manhood and swore vengeance.
He summoned the inhabitants of the valley
from far and near, and told them of the shame the
earl had put upon him. All promised him their
help, and resolved to hold themselves in readiness,
awaiting the first opportunity for attacking the daring
profligate. The earl, in the meanwhile, being quite
ignorant of their designs, played into their hands.
Very soon after his adventure with Brynjulf's wife,
he sent a message of similar purport to Orm Lyrgja,
whose wife Gudrun, on account of her beauty, was
surnamed "Lundarsol" (the Sun of Lunde).<a name="FNanchor_A_34" id="FNanchor_A_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_34" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Orm,
who was a man of great authority in his valley, sent
word to all his neighbors, and after having feasted
the earl's thralls, in order to detain them, refused
to comply with their demand. Gudrun, who saw
them depart, cried jeeringly after them: "Give the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>earl my greeting, and tell him that I will not go to
him unless he sends Thora of Rimul to fetch me."
Thora of Rimul was one of the earl's mistresses,
whom his favor had made rich and powerful.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_34" id="Footnote_A_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_34"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Lund means a grove, and her name might thus be rendered:
"The Sun of the Grove."</p></div>

<p>War-summons was now sent from farm to farm and
a great band of armed peasants came together, and
marched toward Medalhus where Haakon was staying.
He sent in haste a message to his son Erlend,
to meet him at M&ouml;re, whither he intended to go, as
soon as the army of the peasants had dispersed.
Then his time for vengeance would be at hand. In
the meanwhile he would be obliged to dismiss his
men and hide, until the excitement should have subsided.
With a single thrall named Kark, whom he
had received as tooth-gift<a name="FNanchor_A_35" id="FNanchor_A_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_35" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and who had been his
playmate in his boyhood, he fled across the Gaul
river, rode his horse into a hole, and left his cloak
upon the ice, in order that his pursuers might believe
that he had been drowned. Then he hastened to
his mistress, Thora of Rimul, who hid him and the
thrall in a deep ditch under her pigsty. Food, candles,
and bedclothes, were given them, whereupon the
ditch was covered with boards and earth, and the
pigs were driven out over it. As it happened, Olaf
Tryggvesson, whose young life Queen Gunhild had
vainly endeavored to destroy, had just then landed in
Tr&ouml;ndelag and had slain the earl's son Erlend. The
peasants, hearing that he was of the race of Harold
the Fairhaired, received him with delight and accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>him to Rimul, where they thought it
likely that the earl must be hidden.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_35" id="Footnote_A_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_35"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> It was customary to give to infants of high birth a thrall or some
other valuable gift when it got its first tooth. This gift was called a
tooth-gift.</p></div>

<p>After a vain search Olaf called them together,
and mounting a big stone, close to the pigsty, declared
in a loud voice that he would give a great
reward to him who would find the earl and slay
him.</p>

<p>In his damp and malodorous hiding-place the earl
sat, gazing anxiously at his thrall. Every word of
Olaf's speech he could plainly hear, and by the light
of the candle which stood on the earth between
them, he saw that Kark, too, was eagerly listening.</p>

<p>"Why art thou now so pale?" asked the earl,
"and now again as black as earth. Is it not because
thou wilt betray me?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Kark.</p>

<p>"We were both born in the same night," said the
earl, after a pause; "and our deaths will not be far
apart."</p>

<p>They sat for a long time in shuddering silence,
each distrusting the other. From the stillness above
they concluded that night was approaching; but
neither dared to sleep. At last Kark's weariness
overpowered him; but he tossed and mumbled excitedly
in his sleep. The earl waked him and asked
him what he had been dreaming.</p>

<p>"I dreamed," answered Kark, "that we were both
on board the same ship and that I stood at the helm."</p>

<p>"That must mean that thou rulest over thine own
life as well as mine. Be therefore faithful to me,
Kark, as behooves thee, and I will reward thee when
better days come."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more the thrall fell asleep and labored heavily,
as in a nightmare. The earl woke him again and
asked him to relate his dream.</p>

<p>"I thought I was at Hlade," said Kark, "and Olaf
Tryggvesson put a golden ring about my neck."</p>

<p>"The meaning of that," cried the earl, "is that
Olaf Tryggvesson will put a red ring<a name="FNanchor_A_36" id="FNanchor_A_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_36" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> about thy
neck, if thou goest to seek him. Therefore, beware
of him, Kark, and be faithful to me. Then thou
wilt enjoy good things from me, as thou hast done
before."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_36" id="Footnote_A_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_36"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The red ring means, of course, a ring of blood; <i>i.e.</i>, Olaf would
cut Kark's head off.</p></div>

<p>The night dragged slowly along and each sat staring
at the other, with rigid, sleepy eyes, which yet
dared not close. Toward morning, however, the
earl fell backward and sleep overwhelmed him. But
the terrors of his vigil pursued him sleeping. His
soul seemed to be tossed on a sea of anguish. He
screamed in wild distress, rolled about, rose upon his
knees and elbows, and his face was terrible to behold.
Then Kark sprang up, seized his knife and thrust it
into his master's throat. Soon after he presented
himself before Olaf Tryggvesson with the earl's
head, claiming the reward. But Olaf verified the
murdered man's prophecy. He put not a ring of
gold, but one of blood about the traitor's neck
(995).</p>

<p>Earl Haakon was the last champion of paganism
upon the throne of Norway. He was a man of great
natural endowment, fearless yet prudent, formidable
in battle, and in his earlier years justly popular for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his kindliness and liberality. It appears, however,
as if the dignity and power which he conquered
by his own ability intoxicated him and disturbed the
fine equilibrium of his mind. Morally, he was, barring
the profligacy of his later days, a legitimate
product of the old Germanic paganism and the conditions
of life which must of necessity prevail in a
militant community. The shrewdness and faithlessness
which we are apt to censure in the heroic types
of this age, were, in reality, enforced by the hostile
attitude of man to man and the resultant necessity for
distrust and simulation. Candor and veracity were
virtues which, according to the old Norse code,
were only to be practised between friends, while
mendacity and deceit were legitimate weapons
against enemies. Earl Haakon was, however, even
according to his code, culpable in not discriminating
between friend and foe. He rose by faithlessness,
and by faithlessness he fell.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE YOUTH OF OLAF TRYGGVESSON.</h3>


<p>The story of Olaf Tryggvesson's youth, as related
in the sagas, is so marvellous that it can scarcely
claim absolute credibility. The wonder-loving tradition
seized upon him from his very birth as its
favorite hero, and adorned every incident of his
career with a multitude of romantic details. To
separate the framework of fact from the embellishments
of fiction is, under such circumstances, no easy
task. That Olaf's career, even stripped of all fanciful
additions, was as remarkable as any romance,
there can be no question. We have seen how Queen
Gunhild with untiring vigilance tracked him through
forests and wildernesses while he was an infant, and
how his mother Aastrid finally found a place of
refuge with Haakon the Old in Sweden. Her sense
of security could scarcely have been increased when
Earl Haakon succeeded the sons of Gunhild; for the
earl was not of royal blood, and must fear, no less
than Gunhild, a scion of the race of Harold the Fairhaired.
Aastrid therefore determined to go with her
son to Gardarike, or Russia, where her brother, Sigurd
Eriksson, held a position of authority under
King Vladimir. She took passage for herself, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
son, and their attendants, upon a merchant-ship
bound for a Russian port, but the ship was captured
by vikings, who killed some of the passengers and
sold others as slaves. The young Olaf, his foster-father
Thoralf Lousy-Beard, and the latter's son
Thorgills, became the property of a viking named
Klerkon, who killed Thoralf because he was too old
to command any price in the slave-markets. The two
boys he bartered away in Esthonia for a big ram.
The purchaser again disposed of them for a coat and
a cape to a man named Reas, who treated Olaf kindly,
while he put Thorgills to hard labor. With him Olaf
remained for six years. His mother, Aastrid, in the
meanwhile, had been found at a slave-market by a
rich Norse merchant named Lodin, who had recognized
her in spite of her miserable appearance, and
offered to ransom her on condition of her becoming
his wife. She had gladly given her consent and had
returned with him to Norway.</p>

<p>One day Olaf's uncle, Sigurd Eriksson, had occasion
to visit the town in Esthonia where his nephew
was living. He was just riding across the market-place,
when his attention was attracted to a group of
boys who were playing. There was especially one
of them whose appearance struck him, and he called
to him and asked him his name. The boy said that
his name was Olaf. Sigurd now discovered by further
questioning that it was his nephew he was addressing.
He made haste to buy him and his foster-brother
Thorgills, and took them with him to his
house. He enjoined upon Olaf to say nothing
about his race and birth, and the boy promised to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
silent. One day, however, when he was out walking,
he caught sight of the viking Klerkon who had slain
his foster-father. Without a moment's reflection, he
went up and split his skull with an axe which he
happened to have in his hand. Now the penalty for
breaking the public peace was death, and a crowd of
people rushed together, demanding that the boy
should be killed. His uncle, in order to save him,
took him to the queen, Olga, or Allogia, told her
who he was, and implored her protection. The
queen became greatly interested in the beautiful
boy, and had him educated, as behooved a king's
son, in the use of arms and all athletic sports. At
the age of twelve he received men and ships from
Vladimir, and spent some years roaming about as a
viking. He is said to have done important service
to his benefactor, reconquering a province which
had rebelled; but the favor which he enjoyed raised
him up enemies who slandered him, representing him
as a dangerous rival of the king in the affections
both of the queen and the people. Olaf then, at the
advice of Olga, left Russia with his men and ships
and went to Wendland,<a name="FNanchor_A_37" id="FNanchor_A_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_37" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> where he was received with
distinction by King Burislav. He did not, however,
reveal himself as an heir to the throne of Norway,
but travelled under the name Ole the Russian.
Burislav's eldest daughter, or, more probably, sister,
Geira, fell in love with him, and he married her, performed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>many valiant deeds in the service of his
father-in-law, and finally, at the death of his wife,
sailed once more in search of adventures. He was
then twenty-one years old. A dream induced him
to go to Greece and accept Christianity, and he is
also said to have sent a bishop to Russia who converted
Vladimir and Olga to the Christian faith.
Thence Olaf went to Northumberland, Denmark,
Scotland, and France, and had adventures without
number. At the age of twenty-five he found himself
in England, and was summoned to appear before
Princess Gyda, sister of the Irish king, Olaf Kvaran.
She had been the wife of an earl, but was yet a
young and beautiful woman. A great many wooers
were importuning her, among whom a certain Alfvine,
a great champion and man-slayer. A day had
been fixed on which Gyda had promised to choose a
husband, and many high-born men had come together,
hoping to be chosen. All were splendidly attired,
and glittered in scarlet and gold. Olaf, with a few
companions, came sauntering up to the market-place,
and stationed themselves somewhat apart from the
rest as if merely to look on. He had pulled a fur
hood and cape over his head and shoulders, and was
otherwise plainly clad. Gyda, after having somewhat
listlessly regarded the ranks of her wooers,
caught sight of the tall stranger with the fur hood.
She approached him, lifted up his hood, and looked
long and earnestly into his eyes.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_37" id="Footnote_A_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_37"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The present Baltic provinces of Prussia. The Wends were a
Slavonic people, and not identical with the Vandals, with whom they
have often been confounded. The latter, according to the best authority,
were of Germanic origin.</p></div>

<p>"If thou wilt have me," she said, "then I choose
thee for my husband."</p>

<p>Olaf replied that he was not unwilling to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
her at her word; and their betrothal was forthwith
published. Alfvine in great wrath now challenged
the Norseman, fought, and was conquered. The
wedding was then celebrated, and Olaf spent several
years in England and Ireland. He became here
more intimately acquainted with Christianity, was
baptized, and became a zealous defender of the
faith. In Greece, he had, according to the legend,
only been <i>primsigned</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, marked with the sign of
the cross. This was regarded as a sort of compromise
between the old faith and the new, and was
supposed to secure a certain favor from Christ the
White, without entirely forfeiting the good-will of
the old gods.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon annals contain repeated references
to Olaf Tryggvesson, and name him as the chieftain
of a great viking fleet, which, in the year 994,
ravaged the coasts of Essex, Kent, Sussex, and
Hampshire. He even landed with a considerable
army, and put up his winter quarters in Southampton,
levying supplies from the neighboring country.
The unhappy proposition was then made to King
Ethelred II. to buy immunity from further depredations,
and the sum of &pound;10,000 was paid to Olaf and
by him apportioned among his men. Sweyn Forkbeard,
the son of Harold Bluetooth, then exiled
from his native land, is also named as one of the
chieftains concerned in this expedition, though in
the treaty of peace between King Ethelred and the
vikings, which is yet preserved, his name does not
occur. At the confirmation of Olaf, which took
place with great pomp in the same year, King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Ethelred was present, and it is said that Olaf
solemnly vowed, on that occasion, that he would
henceforth never more molest the inhabitants of
England. This promise he appears to have kept.
Sweyn, however, tempted by the great sums of
money which he had extorted, returned again and
again, expelled Ethelred for a time from his kingdom,
and for many years was the virtual ruler of
England.</p>

<p>The fame of Olaf Tryggvesson's deeds spread far
and wide, and also reached Norway, where Earl
Haakon anxiously listened to every rumor regarding
him. That this daring young adventurer would, as
soon as he felt himself strong enough, lay claim to
his paternal kingdom, the earl could not doubt;
and as his own popularity waned, he looked forward
with increasing uneasiness to the conflict. He well
knew the devotion of the people to the race of
Harold the Fairhaired, and the thought took possession
of him that his own safety demanded Olaf
Tryggvesson's death. He confided his plan to
his friend, Thore Klakka, and begged him to
sail to Dublin, where Olaf was then staying, and
either kill him, if the chance presented itself, or entice
him over to Norway where he could easily
destroy him. Thore Klakka accepted this mission,
met Olaf in Dublin, and readily gained his confidence.
The young man was eager for information
concerning his native land, and the earl's emissary
lost no opportunity to urge him to sail thither, the
sooner the better, and take possession of his inheritance.
The earl, said Thore Klakka, was indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
powerful, but if the peasants heard that a descendant
of Harold the Fairhaired was in the land, they would
all forsake him and join the legitimate king. Olaf
was easily persuaded to believe these flattering assurances,
and in the spring of the year 995 sailed
with five ships for Norway. In accordance with
Thore Klakka's treacherous advice, he went straight
to the northwestern shires where Earl Haakon's
power was the greatest, and landed on the island
Moster in H&ouml;rdaland. He raised his tent, planted
the cross on the beach, and had the mass celebrated.
Being convinced of Thore's disinterestedness, he
also accepted his advice not to reveal who he was,
but sail northward to Tr&ouml;ndelag in order to attack
the earl unawares and slay him. Great must have
been Thore's surprise when, on landing at the mouth
of the Drontheim fjord, he found that he had truthfully
represented the condition of the country. The
peasants were united in open rebellion against his
master, and Olaf had only to make himself known in
order to secure immediate allegiance. Of his speech
at Rimul, and the ignominious death of the earl, we
have already spoken. All the chieftains and peasants
of Tr&ouml;ndelag were now summoned to meet at the
Oere-<i>thing</i>, at the mouth of the river Nid, and here
Olaf Tryggvesson was formally proclaimed King of
all Norway. The Tr&ouml;nders from this time forth
reserved for themselves the right to proclaim the
king in the name of the whole country, and even
to this day the sovereigns of Norway are crowned in
Drontheim. Nevertheless, the king was required to
travel from district to district and receive the allegiance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the people. This Olaf now did, and was
everywhere greeted with enthusiastic homage.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span></p>

<br />
<span class="caption">OLAF TRYGGVESSON&#39;S ARRIVAL IN NORWAY.</span>
</div>

<p>The above narrative exhibits several improbabilities,
which, however, do not of necessity vitiate its essential
truthfulness. Of Olaf's sojourn in Russia there
can be no doubt, although, to be sure, the Vladimir
who at that time reigned in Novgorod had no wife
named Allogia or Olga, and if it was his grandmother
Olga to whom reference is made, the king's
jealousy seems altogether unreasonable. Likewise
Olaf's visit to Wendland and his marriage there are
capable of proof from contemporary poems, while
the deeds which are attributed to him in King Burislav's
service have a suspiciously legendary character.
The adventure with Gyda in England also conceals
a framework of fact under its mythical embroidery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>OLAF TRYGGVESSON (995-1000).</h3>


<p>King Olaf's first endeavor, after having ascended
the throne, was to Christianize the country. He was
by nature well adapted for this task, being zealous in
the faith, resolute, and uncompromising. Where
gentle means did not avail he had no hesitation in
employing sword and fire. Vehement as he was by
temperament, brooking no argument, he wasted no
time in weighing the probabilities of success or failure,
but in the conviction of the sanctity of his cause
stormed resistlessly onward and by his impetuosity
and ardor, bore down all opposition. His first appearance
as the champion of the new religion was in
Viken, where he called his relations and adherents
together and told them, that it was his intention to
convert the whole kingdom of Norway to faith
in Christ the White, even though he were to lose his
life in the attempt. In Viken lived at that time his
mother and his step-father, Lodin, who had a large
following of friends and relations. Some of these
were, no doubt, already Christians, or had been
<i>primsigned</i>, as Christianity had, twenty-five years
before, been preached for a short time in this part of
the country by two Germans. No particular oppo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>sition
was therefore offered to the king's command,
and within a brief period Olaf had the satisfaction of
seeing all of Viken&mdash;the old kingdom of his father,
Tryggve&mdash;nominally, at least, converted to Christianity.
It is not to be inferred, however, that the
converts, in accepting baptism, renounced their faith
in the gods whom they had previously worshipped.
On the contrary, they continued to believe in their
existence, and perhaps even secretly to worship
them. The Christian priests themselves professed
belief in Odin and Thor, but represented them as
evil powers who had been conquered by Christ and
thrown into the outer darkness. As Christ had now
all power in heaven and earth, it was futile to invoke
the favor of the vanquished gods by sacrifice. In
this practical shape the new religion unquestionably
appealed to many whom otherwise it could not have
reached. The relation to the old gods had been in
its essence a contract for protection and good crops,
in return for certain tangible values sacrificed. As
Christianity was then preached, it was in many
respects the same thing under a different name.
Prayers formerly addressed to Odin or Frey were
now addressed to Christ and the Virgin Mary, and
though offerings of horses and bullocks were discontinued,
the fragrant incense was still supposed to rise
to the nostrils of the new god and propitiate his favor.
The salient and essential difference between the old
and the new faith, and the only one which the Norsemen
in the beginning vividly apprehended, was the
great doctrine of peace upon earth and good-will
among men. While Odin and Thor took pleasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in bloodshed and rejoiced in war, Christ the White
loved peace and accorded no merit to the man-slayer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus173.jpg" width="500" height="394" alt="OLD NORSE LOOM. FROM FANE NEAR BERGEN." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">OLD NORSE LOOM. FROM FANE NEAR BERGEN.</span>
</div>

<p>That this doctrine, though it was slow to affect
the lives of the new converts, nevertheless from generation
to generation wrought a change in the moral
consciousness of the Norsemen, can scarcely be questioned.
The old Asa faith was inconsistent with any
kind of civilization, because it meant, in the end,
universal destruction. As long as killing was <i>per se</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
meritorious and secured the favor of the gods and
honor among men, no trade but that of arms could
flourish, and every peaceful industry became impossible.
In Iceland, where the spirit of the old Germanic
paganism survived, even long after the introduction
of Christianity, internecine feuds of the most
atrocious character prevailed for centuries, resulting
in a gradual decadence, followed by stagnation and
decay. The result in Norway, as the subsequent
narrative will show, was scarcely better. A universal
exhaustion followed the long carnival of bloodshed,
and a heavy lethargy, lasting for four hundred
years, settled upon the people.</p>

<p>It would be vain to pretend that Olaf Tryggvesson,
when he undertook the task of destroying the Asa
faith, had any conception of the superior sociological
value of the new faith over the old. Not
even the conception of one God, instead of many,
seems to have been emphasized in the preaching of
those days. On the contrary, the Christian religion
was adapted, as far as possible, to the pre-existing
polytheistic notions, and a new hierarchy, consisting
of the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and a host of saints,
was exalted as objects of worship instead of the old
gods. If the character of the religious teaching is to be
inferred from the character of the teachers, it is safe
to conclude that the early Germanic Christianity
was ethically not far removed from the religion which
it came to supplant. Thus we hear much in the Saga
of Olaf Tryggvesson of a priest named Thangbrand,
whose violence, pugnacity, and readiness to kill must
have made him an odd exponent of the gospel of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
peace. Thangbrand was a Saxon, and had been sent
north with many other missionaries to assist in
converting the Danes. Bishop Siric, of Canterbury,
presented him during a visit with a curiously
wrought shield, upon which was the image of the
crucified Christ. Shortly after this occurrence,
Thangbrand made the acquaintance of Olaf Tryggvesson,
who admired the shield greatly and desired
to buy it. The priest received a munificent compensation,
and finding himself suddenly rich, went and
bought a beautiful Irish girl, whose charms had
beguiled him. A German warrior who saw the girl
claimed her, and when his demand was scornfully refused
challenged the priest. A duel was fought and
the German was killed. Some ill feeling was aroused
against Thangbrand by this incident, and he fled to
his friend, Olaf Tryggvesson, and became his court
chaplain. As such he was under the authority of
Bishop Sigurd, an Anglo-Saxon, probably of Norse
descent, whom Olaf had brought with him from
England. Bishop Sigurd was a man of grave and
gentle spirit and a striking contrast to the ferocious
court chaplain.</p>

<p>The Christianization of Viken was followed by
that of Agder. Any decided opposition the king
did not meet until he came to South H&ouml;rdaland,
where a number of mighty chieftains had gathered
in the hope of intimidating him. His fearless and
resolute behavior, however, impressed them so much
that, after some negotiations, they accepted the faith
and were baptized. In return for this concession,
they demanded of the king that he should give his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
sister Aastrid in marriage to the young and high-born
chief, Erling Skjalgsson of Sole; and as the
king thought this marriage in every way desirable,
he gave his consent. Encouraged by his success,
Olaf hastened on to Tr&ouml;ndelag, where was the old
and magnificent temple of Hlade, the principal sanctuary
of Norse paganism. Impelled by holy zeal,
and heedless of the consequences, he broke down the
altar of the gods, burned their images, and carried off
their treasures. The Tr&ouml;nders promptly responded
to this challenge by sending the war-arrow<a name="FNanchor_A_38" id="FNanchor_A_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_38" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> from
house to house, and preparing to fight with the king.
Olaf, who had but a small force with him, did not
venture to offer them battle; but sailed northward to
Haalogaland, where another armed band, under the
command of Thore Hjort and Haarek of Thjotta,
stood ready to receive him. As discretion was here
the better part of valor, the king was in no haste to
land, but returned to Tr&ouml;ndelag, where the peasants
in the meanwhile had dispersed, and began to build
a church in the place where the old temple had
stood. He meant to show the Tr&ouml;nders that he was
neither discouraged nor frightened, that neither
threats nor arms could induce him to desist from his
undertaking. With the desire to strengthen his
power here, where it most needed strengthening, he
began also the building of a royal residence, and laid
the foundation of the future city of Nidaros or
Drontheim (996).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_38" id="Footnote_A_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_38"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The war-arrow (<i>h&aelig;r&ouml;r</i>) was carried by every man to his next
neighbor and stuck into his door, as a sign that war was at hand. To
send or to cut the war-arrow is, therefore, to send a war message.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p></div>

<p>At the beginning of the winter he again summoned
the peasants to meet him at the <i>Frostathing</i>,
and they again responded by an armed concourse,
much greater than the preceding one. When the
assembly was called to order, the king rose and eloquently
expounded the new faith, repeating his
demand that the Tr&ouml;nders should accept baptism
and cease to sacrifice. But he had not spoken long
when the peasants began to interrupt him by angry
shouts, threatening to attack him and chase him out
of the country, unless he was silent. One of them,
a chieftain named Skegge Aasbj&ouml;rnsson or Ironbeard
(Jernskjegge) was especially active in denouncing
the king and exciting the people against him.
Olaf came to the conclusion that nothing was to be
accomplished here by persuasion, and he resolved
reluctantly to postpone his propaganda until a more
propitious time. He then began to talk in a more
conciliatory spirit; promised the peasants to be
present at their sacrificial feast at Yule-tide, and discuss
further with them the change of faith. This
promise was received with great satisfaction, and the
assembly peacefully dispersed.</p>

<p>Shortly before the time appointed for the sacrifice,
Olaf invited the chieftains and the most powerful
peasants from all the neighboring shires, to meet
him at a feast at Hlade. He placed thirty well-manned
ships out in the fjord, where he could summon
them in case of need. The guests were royally
entertained, and as the night advanced became very
drunk. In the morning the king ordered his priests to
celebrate the mass, and a crowd of armed men arrived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
from the ships to attend the religious service. The
guests, who were scarcely in a condition to profit by
the worship, observed with growing uneasiness the
size of the congregation. When the service was at
an end, the king rose and addressed them as follows:</p>

<p>"When we held <i>thing</i> the last time, at Frosten,
I demanded of the peasants that they should accept
baptism; and they, on the other hand, demanded of
me that I should sacrifice with them, as Haakon,
Ethelstan's foster-son, had done. I made no objection
to this, but promised to be present at the sacrificial
feast at M&ouml;re. However, if I am to sacrifice
with you, then I am minded to make a sacrifice of
the biggest kind that has ever been made. I will not
take thralls and criminals; but I will sacrifice the
most high-born men and the mightiest peasants."</p>

<p>He then named six of the most powerful chieftains
present, who had been his most active opponents,
and declared that he meant to offer them up
to Odin and Frey for good crops. Before they had
time to recover from their astonishment, they were
seized, and presented with the alternative of being
baptized, or sacrificed to their own gods. They did
not meditate long before choosing the former. When
the ceremony was finished, they begged to be allowed
to depart, but the king declared that he
would detain them, until they had sent him their
sons or brothers as hostages.</p>

<p>At the Yule-tide sacrifice at M&ouml;re, the king arrived
with a large number of followers. The peasants,
too, came in full force, armed to the teeth, and
defiant as ever. Conspicuous among them was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
burly form of Ironbeard, who was everywhere active
and seemed the head and front of the opposition.
The king endeavored to speak, but the noise was so
great that nobody could hear him. After a while, however,
the tumult subsided, and he repeated his former
demand, that all present should accept baptism, and
believe in Christ the White; to which Ironbeard
haughtily responded, that the peasants were here to
prevent the king from breaking the law, that sacrificing
to the gods was in accordance with the law,
and that Olaf, whether he would or not, would have
to sacrifice, as his predecessors had done. The king
listened patiently to this speech; and declared himself
ready to keep his promise. Accompanied by
many men he entered the temple, leaving his arms
without; for no one was allowed to enter the sanctuary,
bearing arms. The king carried, however, in
his hand a stout stick with a gold head. He inspected
the images of the gods carefully; lingering
especially before that of Thor, which was adorned
with rings of gold and silver. Suddenly, while all
were looking at him, he raised his stick and gave the
god a blow, so that he fell from his pedestal and
broke into many pieces. At the very same instant
his men struck down the other idols; and Ironbeard
who was outside was slain. It was all evidently pre-arranged;
and the peasants, who stood aghast at the
magnitude of the sacrilege, scarcely knew whither to
turn or how to resent it. They looked to Ironbeard to
give voice to their outraged feeling, but Ironbeard was
dead; and there was no one among the rest who had
any desire to speak. When the king, therefore, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the third time, repeated his demand that they be
baptized, or fight with him on the spot, they chose
the former alternative. After having given hostages
for their perseverance in the faith, and their abandonment
of heathen practices, they made haste to
return to their homes. For the slaying of Ironbeard,
Olaf offered to pay a large "atonement" to his relatives,
and to marry his daughter Gudrun. On the
wedding-night, however, Gudrun attempted to murder
him, and was returned to her kinsmen. He can
scarcely have regretted her much, as he immediately
prepared for a new matrimonial venture.</p>

<p>This time his attention was directed to Sigrid the
Haughty, the widow of King Erik the Victorious
of Sweden. Sigrid was rich and wielded a large influence,
being the mother of King Olaf the Swede,
and the possessor of great landed estates in Gautland.
She was, therefore, much afflicted with wooers,
who came from many countries to share her
heart and her possessions. One descendant of Harold
the Fairhaired, Harold Gr&ouml;nske (the Greenlander),
she had burned up, in order to punish his
presumption in offering himself to her.</p>

<p>"I'll teach little kings the risks of proposing to
me," she said, as she ordered the hall where her
wooers slept to be fired.</p>

<p>Olaf Tryggvesson's overtures, which were conducted
by negotiations, she received favorably, and
agreed to meet him at Konghelle, near the boundary
line between Norway and Sweden. Olaf sent in advance,
as a present, a large gold ring which he had
taken from the door of the temple at Hlade. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>was admired, but on being tested was found to be
filled with copper. This incensed Sigrid, but she
still concluded to keep her appointment with Olaf.
They accordingly met and discussed the terms of the
marriage. Olaf demanded, as an indispensable condition,
that Sigrid should be baptized, to which
Sigrid strenuously objected. Then the king sprang
up in great wrath and struck her with his glove in
the face, crying: "What do I want with thee, thou
old heathen jade?" She arose, speechless with anger,
but when she had reached the door she turned
back, saying: "That shall be thy death."</p>

</div>

<p>A short time after this meeting, Sigrid married
Sweyn Forkbeard, of Denmark, possibly with a view
to accomplishing her vengeance upon Olaf. Sweyn's
sister Thyra, whom he had married against her will
to the Wendic King Burislav, fled immediately
after the wedding and arrived in Norway, imploring
Olaf's protection. It is possible that he had met her
before, and was well disposed toward her. At all
events, he solved the problem by marrying her (998),
although she was fully as old as Sigrid the Haughty,
and had had two husbands before.</p>

<p>After this brief interval, devoted to personal affairs,
Olaf returned once more to the task to which
he had consecrated his life. The chieftains of
Haalogaland, who had prevented him from landing
when he came to convert them, still remained unsubdued;
and the time was now convenient for teaching
them a lesson in submission. There were especially
three, viz.: Thore Hjort, Eyvind Kinriva, and
Haarek of Thjotta, the son of Eyvind Scald-Spoiler,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
who were the chieftains and leaders of the tribal
aristocracy of those regions. It was natural enough
that these men, who derived much of their dignity
from their priesthoods and consequent identification
with the old religion, should be most tenacious in
their adherence to the faith which was the foundation
of their power. Haarek, who descended from a
daughter of Harold the Fairhaired, felt himself to
be quite as great a man as King Olaf, and he was in
no wise disposed to submit without a trial of strength.
It so happened that two men from Haalogaland,
named Sigurd and Hauk, had been captured by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
king and escaped. These, pretending to be the
king's enemies, sought refuge with Haarek, and were
well received by him. One day they proposed a
sailing tour, to which their host willingly assented.
They took provisions and beer with them in the
boat, set sail, and steered for Nidaros, where they
delivered Haarek into the power of the king. He
stubbornly refused to be baptized, but was, nevertheless,
after a brief detention, given a ship and permitted
to return unmolested to his home. From
that day, however, Haarek, though making no pretence
of friendship, acted as the ally of the king.
He even helped to betray his friend, Eyvind Kinriva,
into Olaf's hands. The king presented Eyvind
with the usual alternative of baptism or death, but
with the unusual result that the latter was preferred.
Thore Hjort was now alone left; he allied himself
with Raud the Strong, who had the reputation of
being a wizard, and delivered a regular battle in
which he was defeated by the king. Raud escaped
on his fleet dragon-ship, while Thore was pursued by
Olaf, who set a dog named Vige on his track, saying:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

IN SILGJORD, BRATSBERG AMT." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">INSTRUMENT OF UNKNOWN USE, POSSIBLY A PAIR OF SCALES, FOUND
IN SILGJORD, BRATSBERG AMT.</span>
</div>

<p>"Vige, catch thou the stag."<a name="FNanchor_A_39" id="FNanchor_A_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_39" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_39" id="Footnote_A_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_39"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Hjort means a stag.</p></div>

<p>The dog did actually overtake Thore, and the king
cut him down with his own hands. Olaf strove in
vain to get on the track of Raud, but the weather
was so terrible that he did not venture to go to sea.
He began to suspect, after a while, that it was Raud
himself who, by his witchcraft, had aroused the elements;
and after having waited for several days and
nights for a change in the weather, he called Bishop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Sigurd to him and asked his advice. The bishop, it
is told, raised up a crucifix, surrounded by lighted
tapers, in the prow of the king's ship, "The Crane,"
and stood himself beside it, clad in sacerdotal vestments,
praying and scattering holy water. Instantly
the storm ceased about "The Crane," though it still
roared wildly under the heavens, and the smoke of
the lashed waves stood like a wall on either side.
The men now seized the oars and rowed in toward
the island where Raud was living, "The Crane" keeping
the lead and the other ships following in the
smooth water in her wake. Raud was surprised while
asleep, and as he still refused to become a Christian,
was tortured until he died. The king forced an adder
down his throat, according to the legend; and it cut
its way through his side, killing him by its poison.</p>

<p>There is much in this story which is obviously
legendary. But there is one circumstance which
stamps the adventure itself as essentially true, viz.:
the detailed description of Raud's ship, "The Serpent,"
which the king took, and which figures later in
the battle of Svolder. One may be reluctant to believe
that a man so chivalrous and noble as Olaf Tryggvesson
on other occasions proved himself to be, can
have been guilty of the cruelty which is here attributed
to him. This instance is, however, not a solitary
one. Eyvind Kinriva, when he refused to be
baptized, had glowing coals put upon his stomach,
at the king's command, and expired under horrible
tortures. Olaf's fanaticism led him to believe that
praise rather than censure was due to him for thus
punishing the enemies of God. It is, indeed, proba<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>ble
that a man of gentler calibre, and more squeamish
in the selection of his means, would never have
accomplished even the nominal Christianization of
Norway. In fact, so great was Olaf's zeal, and so
single his purpose, that he subordinated all other
concerns to this one great object, the thought of
which filled him with a noble enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Even before he had secured the allegiance of the
surviving chief of Haalogaland, Haarek of Thjotta,
who, with all his household, accepted the Christian
faith, he sent messengers to the Faeroe Isles, Iceland,
and Greenland, and commanded the chieftains
there to renounce their old religion. Sigmund
Bresteson, the Earl of the Faeroe Isles, whom he
summoned to him, arrived in Norway (999) and was
baptized. Thangbrand, who was sent to Iceland to
preach the gospel, had at first a considerable success,
baptizing such important chiefs as Hall of the
Side, and Gissur the White, and the great lawyer
Njaal of Bergthor's knoll. The pugnacious priest,
however, soon got into difficulties by his readiness
to draw his sword, killed several men, was outlawed,
and compelled to leave the island. In Norway,
where Olaf had given him the church at Moster, he
had, previous to his departure for Iceland, found it
inconvenient to live on his income, and in order to increase
his revenue, had been in the habit of making
forays into the neighboring shires, replenishing his
stores at the expense of the heathen. This freebooting
propensity incensed the king, and Thangbrand's
missionary expedition to Iceland was undertaken as a
penance for his misbehavior. It had, however, far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
greater results than either Olaf or the priest could
have anticipated. The public sentiment in Iceland,
after Thangbrand's flight, changed with astonishing
rapidity in favor of the new faith, which was legally
accepted at the <i>Althing</i> June, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1000.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">OLD LOOM FROM THE FAEROE ISLES.</span>
</div>

<p>Olaf's great achievement, as the first successful
propagandist of Christianity on the throne of Norway,
surrounded his name with a halo which dazzled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
his biographers and disposed them to exalt him beyond
his deserts. For all that, it is a fact that his
contemporaries, many of whom had small reason to
love him, were no less dazzled by his brilliant personality
than his biographers. In the first place, his
manly beauty and his resemblance to Haakon the
Good, which was frequently commented upon, predisposed
the people in his favor. Secondly, his
natural kindliness and winning manners attracted
every one who came in contact with him. Last, but
not least, his extraordinary skill in athletic sports and
the use of arms was greatly admired. He could, as
Snorre relates, use his right and his left hand equally
well in shooting; he could play with three spears at
once, so that one was always in the air; he could
run forward and backward on the oars of a ship
while the men were rowing. In daily intercourse he
was affable and generous, fond of a joke, and easily
moved to laughter and to wrath. In anger he could
do things which he later regretted; and we have
seen how, when fired with holy zeal, he committed
acts which he ought to have regretted, though there
is no evidence that he did. His love of splendor in
attire and surroundings may be accounted a weakness,
but it served, nevertheless, to endear him to
his people.</p>

<p>Although surrounded by enemies on all sides, Norway
suffered but little from foreign wars during the
brief reign of Olaf Tryggvesson. Gudr&ouml;d, the last
surviving son of Erik Blood-Axe, made an attack
upon Viken in the summer of 999, but was defeated
and slain in the king's absence by his brothers-in-law,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Thorgeir and Hyrning. Much more dangerous to
King Olaf proved the hostility of Sigrid the
Haughty, who was watching for an opportunity to
take revenge upon him. Although he must have
been well aware of the risks, he did not hesitate
to furnish this opportunity. His queen, Thyra, had
great estates in Wendland and Denmark, and was
dissatisfied, because she was deprived of the revenues
which they had formerly brought her. Whenever he
spoke to her, she always contrived to bring in something
about these estates, and by appeals to his
vanity egg him on to war with her brother Sweyn
Forkbeard, who withheld from her her rightful property.
When these tactics failed, she resorted to
prayers and tears, until her husband's patience
was wellnigh exhausted. If only for the sake of
domestic peace, an expedition to Wendland began
to be discussed as an approaching possibility. One
Sunday in March&mdash;it was Palm Sunday&mdash;the king
met a man in the street who sold spring vegetables.
He bought a bunch and brought it to the queen, remarking
that these vegetables were large, considering
the earliness of the season. The queen, who was, as
usual, weeping for her estates in Wendland, thrust
the vegetables contemptuously away, and with the
tears streaming down her face, cried: "Greater gifts
did my father, Harold Gormsson, give me when, as
a child, I got my first teeth; he came hither to Norway
and conquered it; while thou, for fear of my
brother Sweyn, darest not journey through Denmark
in order to get me what belongs to me, and of
which I have been shamefully robbed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>To this King Olaf wrathfully replied: "Never
shall I be afraid of thy brother Sweyn, and if we
meet, he shall succumb."</p>

<p>Summons was now sent through all the shires of
the land, calling upon the chieftains to join the king
with as many ships as were by law required of them.
He had himself just finished a ship of extraordinary
size and beauty, called "The Long-Serpent," the fame
of which spread through all the lands of the North.
It was 56 Norwegian ells, or about 112 feet from prow
to stern, had 52 oars on either side, and could accommodate
600 warriors. The crew was made up of
picked men, none of whom must be over 60 and less
than 20 years of age. Only one exception was permitted
to this rule in the case of Einar Eindridsson surnamed
Thambarskelver, who was but 18 years old,
but the most skilful archer in all Norway. With his
bow, called Thamb, from which he derived his surname,
he could shoot a blunt arrow through a
raw ox-hide, depending from a pole.</p>

<p>In order to distinguish "The Long-Serpent" from
the dragon-ship he had taken from Raud the Strong,
Olaf called the latter "The Short-Serpent." He had
many other excellent ships besides, and his brothers-in-law,
Erling Skjalgsson of Sole, Thorgeir, and
Hyrning, joined him, each with a large and finely-equipped
galley.</p>

<p>When he steered southward to Wendland, he had
about 60 ships of war besides a similar number of
smaller transports. King Burislav, in spite of his
union with Thyra, received him well, possibly on account
of the earlier relationship through Geira, or on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
account of their common hostility to Sweyn Forkbeard
in Denmark. The question of the estates was
amicably settled and Olaf, after having been splendidly
entertained, prepared to start homeward. The rumor,
in the meanwhile, had gone abroad that he was in
Wendland, and his enemies, in order to gather a sufficiently
large force to destroy him, employed Earl
Sigvalde, the chief of the Jomsvikings, to detain
him and lull him into a false security. In this the
treacherous earl succeeded. He gained Olaf's confidence,
scouted the thought that Sweyn Forkbeard
should ever dare attack him; and finally offered to
escort him on the way with his own fleet and pilot
him through the dangerous waters along the Wendic
coast. It was of no avail that Sigvalde's wife, Aastrid,
the night before Olaf's departure, warned him
against her husband as openly as she dared, and proposed
to send a ship along in case of danger. A
strange infatuation bound him to his false friend. At
Sigvalde's advice he even permitted part of his fleet
to start in advance, as the straits between the islands
were narrow. The traitor, in the meanwhile, was in
constant communication with King Sweyn, at whose
request he agreed to separate Olaf from his main
force and lead him into the trap which his foes had
prepared for him. Besides King Sweyn there were
Earl Erik, who had the death of his father, Earl
Haakon, to avenge, and King Olaf the Swede, the
son of Sigrid the Haughty. All these were lying in
wait with about sixty or seventy war galleys, behind
the little island of Svolder, between the island R&uuml;gen
and the present Prussian province, Pomerania. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
their hiding-place they looked for several days in vain
for the Norse ships, and began to grow impatient.
They had gone ashore with their crews in order to
while away the time, and the three commanders
were standing together, sweeping the horizon with
their glances, when, to their delight, the Norse transport
fleet hove in sight, spreading its sails before the
favoring breeze.</p>

<p>The day was fair. The sun shone brightly, and
the surface of the water barely curled into slight
undulations. Gayly the proud ships stood out to the
sea, one larger and finer than the other. When King
Sweyn saw the beautiful ship of Erling Skjalgsson
of Sole, he was sure that it must be "The Long Serpent,"
though it had no dragon-head in its prow.
"Afraid is Olaf Tryggvesson to-day," he said, "since
he dares not carry a head on his dragon." "This
ship I know well by its striped sails," said Earl Erik;
"it does not belong to the king, but to Erling Skjalgsson.
Let it pass; for if, as I suppose, he is himself
on board, we shall be best served, if he and his band
are not found among those with whom we are to
fight to-day."</p>

<p>By twos and threes the great ships of the Norse
chieftains passed by, and every time the Swedish and
the Danish king were sure that one of them must be
"The Long Serpent." Presently Sigvalde's fleet of
eleven ships became visible, and having received signals
from the allied princes, turned its course suddenly
around the island, to the great astonishment
of Thorkill Dyrdill, who was steering the king's
ship, "The Crane," right in its wake. King Sweyn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
at the sight of this splendid galley, could no more be
restrained, but ordered his men aboard, in spite of
Earl Erik's warning. He even insinuated that the
latter was a coward who had no ambition to avenge
his father; to which the earl replied, that before the
setting of the sun it would be seen who was the more
eager for battle, the Swedes and Danes, or he and
his men.</p>

<p>Thorkill Dyrdill dropped the sails of "The Crane,"
and, taking in the situation at a glance, determined
to await the arrival of King Olaf. Then came "The
Short Serpent," casting golden gleams across the
water from its shining dragon-head; and King Sweyn
cried exultingly: "Loftily shall the Serpent bear me
to-night, and I shall steer her."</p>

<p>Earl Erik, in whom King Sweyn's recent taunt was
rankling, replied: "Even if Olaf Tryggvesson had
no larger ship than this, Sweyn, with all his army of
Danes, could not win it from him."</p>

<p>When at last "The Long Serpent" reared its flaming
prow against the horizon, shooting long beams
in the sun, the three princes marvelled at its beauty.
Many a one trembled, too, with fear, when he saw
the majestic ship approaching, and the dense rows of
polished shields and swords flashing from afar.</p>

<p>"This glorious ship," said Earl Erik, "is fitting
for such a king as Olaf Tryggvesson; for it may, in
sooth, be said of him, that he is distinguished above
all other kings as 'The Long Serpent' above all
other ships."</p>

<p>All King Olaf's fleet, with the exception of eleven
ships, were now out of sight, and many of his chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>tains
advised him not to fight against such heavy
odds. He would not listen to their counsel, but
ordered the ships to be bound together and every
thing to be prepared for battle.</p>

<p>"Down with the sails," he cried with a loud voice,
which could be clearly heard across the waters;
"never have I yet fled from any battle. God rules
over my life. Never will I flee; for he is no king
who shuns his foes because of fear."</p>

<p>The whole hostile fleet now rowed forward from
behind the island, and it seemed as if the sea was
covered with ships as far as the eye could reach. King
Sweyn, with his sixty galleys, became first visible.</p>

<p>"What chieftain is that right opposite to us?"
asked King Olaf.</p>

<p>"That is King Sweyn with the Danish army,"
answered one of his men.</p>

<p>"I have no fear of them," said the king. "Never
yet have Danes beaten Norsemen, and they will not
beat us to-day. But to what chieftain belong the
standards there on the right?"</p>

<p>He was told that they belonged to Olaf, the king
of the Swedes.</p>

<p>"The Swedes," said he, "would find it more
agreeable to sit at home and lick their sacrificial
bowls,<a name="FNanchor_A_40" id="FNanchor_A_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_40" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> than to meet our arms to-day on 'The Long
Serpent.' Scarcely do I think that we need be afraid
of those horse-eaters. But whose are those large
ships on the left side of the Danes?"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_40" id="Footnote_A_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_40"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> This is meant as a taunt at the Swedes, who were yet heathen.</p></div>

<p>"That," answered his informant, "is Earl Erik,
Earl Haakon's son."</p>

<p>"From them we may expect a hard battle; for,
methinks, Earl Erik has considerable reason for attacking
us; and he and his men are Norsemen like
ourselves,"</p>

<p>While the king was speaking, Queen Thyra, who
had accompanied him, came up on deck. Seeing
the enormous hostile fleet before her, and the smallness
of her husband's force, she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Now thou must not weep," said King Olaf;
"for now thou hast, indeed, gotten what was due to
thee in Wendland; and to-day I mean to demand of
thy brother Sweyn thy tooth-gift which thou hast so
often asked me for."</p>

<p>King Sweyn was the first to attack, but after a
short and stubborn fight was compelled to retreat.
One of his galleys was disabled after the other, and
there was a great carnage. King Olaf himself stood
on the poop royal<a name="FNanchor_A_41" id="FNanchor_A_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_41" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of "The Long Serpent," where all
could see him, directing the defence, and himself
fighting with spears and arrows. His helmet and
his shield, which were gilt, shone in the sun. Over
his armor he wore a short tunic of scarlet silk.
While the Danes were in full retreat, the Swedes
hastened to their rescue, and they now bore for a
while the brunt of the battle. For every Swede or
Dane that fell there were ten ready to take his place;
while the Norsemen, surrounded on all sides by
hostile ships, had to endure an incessant shower of
spears and arrows, and the shock of repeated onsets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that had to be repelled by the sword in hand-to-hand
conflicts. However tired and thirsty they were, they
could give themselves no respite. Every man that
fell or was disabled by wounds left a gap that could
not be filled. And yet, in spite of the great numerical
superiority of their foes, they would have
carried the day at Svolder, if Earl Erik had not commenced
a destructive attack upon the right wing,
while the Swedes and the Danes were engaging the
centre. In fact, the latter were again retreating in
disorder before the furious bravery of King Olaf's
men, when Earl Erik rowed up alongside the outermost
ship on the right, with his great galley, "The
Iron Ram," and made a vigorous onslaught. Here
Norseman met Norseman, and the numbers had to
decide. The men on the king's ship fought desperately,
but were overpowered, and leaped into the
sea, or saved themselves on board the next ship.
The first was then cut adrift, and Erik, in accordance
with a well-matured plan, engaged the next and the
next. At last all of King Olaf's ships except "The
Long Serpent" were cut adrift, and their defenders
slain. Then a space was cleared in front of "The Iron
Ram," and she was rowed forward with tremendous
force, striking "The Long Serpent" amidships. The
good ship creaked in all her beams; but as there was
scarcely any wind no great damage was done. Einar
Thambarskelver, who stood before the mast on "The
Long Serpent," saw Earl Erik standing near the prow
of "The Iron Ram," covered by many shields. He
bent his bow and sent an arrow whizzing over his
head, and in the next instant another, which flew be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>tween
the earl's arm and his body. The earl, turning
to the archer, Finn Eyvindsson, said: "Shoot that
tall man on the forward deck."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_41" id="Footnote_A_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_41"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> <i>L&ouml;ftingen</i> is the elevated deck in the stern of an old war-galley,
and corresponds very nearly to the poop royal of French and Spanish
men-of-war of the thirteenth century.</p></div>

<p>Finn aimed an arrow at Einar just as he was
bending his bow for a third shot at the earl; the
arrow hit the bow in the middle, and it broke with a
loud crash.</p>

<p>"What was it that broke?" asked Olaf.</p>

<p>"Norway from thy hands, my king," cried Einar.</p>

<p>"So great was not the breach, I hope," the king
made answer; "take my bow and shoot with that."</p>

<p>He flung his own bow to the archer, who seized it,
bent it double, and flung it back. "Too weak is the
king's bow," he said.</p>

<p>Earl Erik was now preparing for the final attack,
and he could not doubt its result.</p>

<p>King Olaf's men were in a desperate strait, from
which no escape was possible. The king flung forth
his spears, two at a time, from his station on the
poop, and many men were transfixed by his keen
shafts. He watched at the same time the combat
on the forward deck, whither the earl was just directing
his attack, and it seemed to him that his men
made no headway.</p>

<p>"Do you wield your swords with so little strength,"
he cried, "since they bite so poorly?"</p>

<p>"No," answered a warrior; "but our swords are
dull and broken."</p>

<p>The king then hastened to the forward deck, where
there was a large chest of arms. He opened it and
took out armfuls of bright, sharp swords, which he
flung to his men. As he stooped down, the blood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
trickled down over his hands from under his armor.
His men then knew that he was wounded, but it was
no time then for nursing any one's wounds. The
earl's men were storming forward, and the tired
Norsemen fell in heaps, and could no longer keep
them back. The arrows rained thick and fast about
the king, and it was obvious he could not hold out
much longer. He was visible to all; for he made no
attempt to hide or shelter himself. One of his
trusted men, Kolbj&ouml;rn Stallare, who saw his danger,
sprang upon the poop and placed himself at his side.
His resemblance to the king had often been remarked
upon; moreover, he was of the same height,
and was similarly dressed. The storm of missiles was
now directed against both, and, as they raised their
shields, they were thickly fringed with arrows. The
clash of arms, the groans of the dying, and the whizzing
of flying missiles, filled the air. The king let his
shield drop and looked out over the ship. There
were but eight men alive, besides himself and Kolbj&ouml;rn.
He raised the shield above his head and leaped
overboard. Kolbj&ouml;rn followed his example, but was
picked up by the earl's men, who mistook him for
the king. That the latter was drowned, there can be
no reasonable doubt, although there is a legend,
which was fondly cherished, that he swam to the
galley which Aastrid, Earl Sigvalde's wife, had sent
out for his rescue. According to this story, he made
a pilgrimage to Rome, and lived long as a hermit in
the Holy Land.</p>

<p>King Olaf Tryggvesson was thirty-six years old
when he died (1000). Queen Thyra, who, with good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
reason, held herself responsible for his death, was inconsolable.
When she came up on deck, after the
battle, and saw the destruction she had wrought she
broke into lamentation. Earl Erik was moved by
her sorrow and spoke kindly to her, assuring her
that if she would return to Norway she would be
accorded the honor which was due to her as the
widow of so great a king. She thanked him for his
offer, but said that she had no heart to survive her
lord. On the ninth day after the battle she died.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE EARLS ERIK AND SWEYN HAAKONSSON (1OOO-1015).
THE DISCOVERY OF VINLAND.</h3>


<p>After King Olaf's death at Svolder, the allied
princes divided his kingdom between them. To
Earl Erik were given all the shires along the western
coast from Finmark to Lindesness,<a name="FNanchor_A_42" id="FNanchor_A_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_42" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> with the
exception of seven, which were allotted to King Olaf
the Swede. All the shires from Lindesness, including
Agder, to the Swedish boundary, with the exception
of Ranrike, came into the possession of Sweyn
Forkbeard. Ranrike (which is now a part of Sweden)
was given to the Swedish king, who again gave it, as
well as his other possessions in Norway, in fief to his
brother-in-law, Earl Sweyn, the brother of Earl Erik,
on condition of his paying one half of the royal
revenues to his feudal overlord, and placing a specified
number of troops at his disposal in case of war.
On similar conditions Earl Erik received the eastern
shires, Raumarike and Vingulmark, in fief from
Sweyn Forkbeard.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_42" id="Footnote_A_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_42"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Lindesness is the southernmost point in Norway.</p></div>

<p>Though a man of ability and many noble qualities,
Earl Erik never succeeded in asserting his sway over
Norway as his father, Earl Haakon, had done; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Earl Sweyn could boast even less authority than his
brother. In the Oplands semi-independent kings of
the race of Harold the Fairhaired were still living;
and in Rogaland Olaf Tryggvesson's brother-in-law,
Erling Skjalgsson of Sole, refused to recognize the
supremacy of either the earls or the kings whom
they represented. He surrounded himself with a
court which, in magnificence, equalled that of the
earls, if it did not surpass it. Ninety warriors constituted
his daily household, and when occasion
demanded he kept 240 or more. Of thralls he kept
thirty for his daily attendance, besides a large
number who cultivated his lands. He was a good
master, stimulating them to thrift and economy.
He demanded of each a certain fixed amount of
labor, and gave him a piece of land for cultivation.
When the required task was over the thrall's time
was his own, and he was at liberty to apply it for his
own advantage. The products of his land he sold
to his master at the market rates, and was thus
enabled to buy his freedom within one, two, or three
years. Over his freedmen Erling continued to exercise
a supervising care, employing them at wages or
on shares in the fisheries, in the reclaiming of land
from the forests, or in other branches of industry.</p>

<p>Clinging, as he did, tenaciously to the authority
which Olaf Tryggvesson had conferred upon him,
Erling could not avoid coming into collision with
the authority of the earls. He exacted a land-tax
from the peasants of Rogaland, and, as Earl Erik did
the same, the poor landowners had to pay a double
tax, unless they were prepared to offer resistance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus203.jpg" width="272" height="500" alt="SHUTTLES OF IRON AND OF WHALEBONE; AND WEIGHTS FOR THE
LOOM." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">SHUTTLES OF IRON AND OF WHALEBONE; AND WEIGHTS FOR THE
LOOM.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>But both the earl and Erling were too powerful to
make such a course advisable. It is, indeed, strange
that Erik, with his great connections abroad, should
have tolerated the defiance of this small potentate
without in some way trying to break his power. It
is true, Erling had a large number of mighty kinsmen
and supporters in many of the coast-shires; and he
would have been able to make a strong resistance.
But it is scarcely credible that he could have maintained
himself against Earl Erik, if the latter had
seriously resolved to punish him. In fact, Earl Erik,
although his early life had been passed in the tumult
of war, was essentially a conciliatory character. A
mighty warrior he was when duty or diplomatic
necessity forced him to fight; but he hesitated to
draw his sword, except on extreme provocation.
It was his misfortune, by his birth and the circumstances
which brought him into power, to represent
an age and a r&eacute;gime which were destined to pass
away. It was the so-called "heroic" age&mdash;that is,
the age of turbulent individualism, opposed to the
modern conception of the state. It is obvious that
Erik had no sympathy with the feudalism instituted
by the conquests of Harold the Fairhaired; probably
he did not comprehend the progressive idea
which dignified King Harold's ambition and made
him the conscious or unconscious agent of advancing
civilization. It is proof enough of this to state, that
Erik allowed the dependencies of Norway, the Orkneys,
and the Shetland Isles to detach themselves
from the motherland, and made no attempt to force
them back to their allegiance. There was no inspir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>ing
tradition in his family, as in that of Harold the
Fairhaired, demanding a great and united kingdom;
but, on the contrary, a local separatistic tradition,
identifying him with the greatness and fame of a
special locality. To have carried out this tradition
completely, the Earls Erik and Sweyn ought to have
remained pagans as their father was before them.
They seem, indeed, to have been conscious of a certain
inconsistency in accepting Christianity, for they
made not the faintest attempt to assert their faith in
their relation to the people, or to check the relapse
into paganism, which became very prevalent during
their reign.</p>

<p>Quite in keeping with the general reactionary
character of the earls' government, was the revival
of the viking cruises which, during the reign of
Olaf Tryggvesson, had been diminishing in frequency.
Earl Erik himself had been a valiant
viking in his youth, and probably could see no harm
in the careless and predatory life in which the old
Germanic paganism found its most characteristic expression.
A great impetus must have been given to
this mode of life by Sweyn Forkbeard's repeated
expeditions to England, in which a large number of
Norsemen participated. It makes little difference if
the aggressors were nominally Christians; their actions
were an outburst of the old, tribal pagan
spirit, which respected no right but that of might.</p>

<p>It was natural that the earls, if they expected to
make their dominion permanent, should endeavor to
extend their connections beyond Tr&ouml;ndelag. The
strength of a government in those days depended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
largely upon the support which it received among
the chieftains or tribal aristocracy, whose sentiments
were usually reflected by the peasants. It was therefore
necessary in some way to conciliate the late
adherents of Olaf Tryggvesson, whose influence
upon public opinion could be utilized to advantage.
It may have been some such consideration which restrained
Earl Erik from attacking Erling Skjalgsson.
It is obvious that the overtures which he made
to Einar Thambarskelver had the same end in view.
We have seen how the young archer came within
an inch of ending the earl's days at Svolder,
thereby exciting the admiration of Erik for his skill
and bravery. After the battle, the earl, with his
usual generosity, spared his life, and sought in many
ways to secure his friendship. He married him to
his sister, the high-minded Bergljot, and gave him
large fiefs, so that no chieftain in Tr&ouml;ndelag could
rival him in power.</p>

<p>Toward his brother, Sweyn, Earl Erik behaved
with the same magnanimity that he showed toward
all who had claims on him. Sweyn was dissatisfied
because of the disparity in their positions; he ruling
over one third of the country as the vassal of the
Swedish king, while Erik held two thirds as an independent
sovereign. These complaints were repeated
with growing importunity, until Erik resolved to
abandon the government. He called together the
chieftains and the mightiest peasants of the country,
and abdicated (1015) in favor of his son Haakon and
his brother Sweyn, between whom he divided his
share of the land in equal portions. As Haakon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was not yet of full age, Einar Thambarskelver
was appointed his guardian. In the autumn of the
year 1015, Earl Erik set sail for England, and assisted
Knut the Mighty in the subjugation of that
country. He was joined later by his son Haakon,
who was expelled from Norway by Olaf Haroldsson,
and was compelled to swear that he would never renew
his claims to the kingdom. Earl Erik died in
England, from the effect of a surgical operation, in
1023 or 1024. Before their expulsion, the Earls
Sweyn and Haakon made peace with Erling Skjalgsson,
confirming him in the possession of the fiefs
which he had received from Olaf Tryggvesson, embracing
all the coast-shires from the Sogne-fiord to
Lindesness. To cement their friendship, Earl
Sweyn gave his daughter, Sigrid,<a name="FNanchor_A_43" id="FNanchor_A_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_43" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in marriage to
Erling's son, Aslak.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_43" id="Footnote_A_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_43"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Her name is differently given as Sigrid and Gunhild.</p></div>

<p>It was during the reign of the earls that the
North American continent was first visited by the
Norsemen. An Icelander named Bjarne Herjulfsson,
during a voyage to Greenland (986), was blown out
of his course, and discovered, while sailing northward,
an unknown land on his left. He concluded
that it could not be Greenland, as there were no
glaciers, but only low, wooded heights sloping gently
toward the ocean. On his arrival in Greenland,
Bjarne told of the new country he had seen, but was
much ridiculed because he had not gone ashore and
explored it. His story made a great impression,
however, upon the adventurous Leif, son of Erik the
Red. He bought Bjarne's ship, and, with a crew of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
thirty-five men, set sail for the unknown shore in the
West (1000). The first land he saw was on his right
as he sailed southward. It was full of glaciers and
had no grass. He called it Helluland, because it
seemed, at the foot of the glaciers, to be one flat expanse.<a name="FNanchor_A_44" id="FNanchor_A_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_44" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
This must have been the present Labrador.
Continuing his southward course, Leif came to a
country which was well wooded, and had long,
smooth beaches. He called it Markland (Woodland),
and the supposition is that it was Nova
Scotia. With a stiff northeaster, he made considerable
headway, and came, after another day's voyage,
to an island where a river flowed into the sea.
As it was ebb-tide he could not land, but so eager
were the men to explore the country, that they
jumped overboard and waded ashore. The statement
that the sun rose in this region, on the shortest
day of the year, at half-past seven and set at half-past
four, indicates a latitude of 41&deg; 24' 10"; Leif, accordingly,
must have landed somewhere in the neighborhood
of Cape Cod or Fall River, Mass. He found
the country possessed of many advantages. It was
so mild in the winter that cattle would require no
stable-feeding. The rivers abounded in salmon and
the woods in game. A German, named Tyrker, became
so enthusiastic over the discovery of grapes,
that he relapsed into his native tongue, and was supposed,
by the crew to be intoxicated. Leif and his
men put up some booths and spent the winter in the
new land, which they called Vinland, but set sail
the following spring for Greenland.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_44" id="Footnote_A_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_44"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> <i>Helle</i>, in Norwegian, means a great flat stone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p></div>

<p>It is evident from the description here given that
there is either some mistake in regard to the latitude,
or the climate of New England must have
grown severer during the last nine centuries. Cattle
could scarcely be left in the open air in the Cape
Cod region nowadays. Nor do grapes of any choice
variety grow wild in the chill blasts which now gambol
about the Massachusetts coast; and the tart fox
grape, it seems, could scarcely rouse enthusiasm even
in the breast of a German.</p>

<p>A second expedition to Vinland was undertaken
in 1006 by the Icelander Thorfinn Karlsevne and his
wife Gudrid. Among their followers, who numbered
160, were Erik the Red's son Thorwald and
his daughter Freydis. This was the first expedition
which was undertaken with a view to colonizing the
country. Cattle were therefore taken along, and
preparations made for a permanent settlement.
Thorfinn found without difficulty the booths abandoned
by Leif, and himself added to their number.
A strange people, whom the Norsemen called <i>Skraellings</i>,
came to them in light boats made of skin and
offered furs in exchange for cloth, ornaments, and
weapons. Karlsevne, however, refused to sell them
weapons; and when, during the negotiations, a bull
came out of the woods and began to roar, the Skraellings
became frightened and hastened away. From
that time forth they became hostile to the settlers
and attacked them repeatedly, killing several of their
number. This perpetual state of insecurity disheartened
the survivors, and after a sojourn of three years
in Vinland, they returned to Greenland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>OLAF THE SAINT (1016-1030).</h3>


<p>We have seen that Christianity did not advance
in Norway during the mild and lax government of
the earls. Olaf Tryggvesson, with all his zeal and
vigor, could not in the short space of five years
eradicate paganism from the Norsemen's hearts;
and after his death a great number of those whom
he had compelled to profess the Christian name
relapsed into their former practices. It was not
until King Olaf Haroldsson by his life, and still
more by his death, took the imagination of the
Norsemen captive, that Christianity became securely
established in the land.</p>

<p>Olaf was the son of Harold Gr&ouml;nske and a grandson
of Bj&ouml;rn the Merchant, who was slain by his
brother, Erik Blood-axe. It was accordingly a new
branch of the race of Harold the Fairhaired who
with him ascended the throne. His father, as we
have seen, was burned to death by Sigrid the
Haughty, whom he had the presumption to woo,
regardless of the fact that he had a wife named
Aasta, who was then expecting her confinement.
Olaf was born in the house of his maternal grandfather
and passed his childhood with Sigurd Syr,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
king in Ringerike, whom his mother married. Sigurd
Syr was a grandson of Sigurd the Giant, a son
of Harold the Fairhaired and Snefrid, and had
accordingly as much right to the throne as Olaf
Tryggvesson, who was then reigning. He was,
however, a quiet and unpretentious man, who was
contented to raise his crops and superintend his
large estates, without troubling himself with ambitious
projects. During the infancy of his step-son,
Sigurd Syr entertained Olaf Tryggvesson at his
house and was induced by him to accept Christianity.
It is said that King Olaf on this occasion
stood sponsor at the baptism of his namesake and
kinsman.</p>

<p>When Olaf Haraldsson was ten years old, his step-father
begged him, one day, to go and saddle his
horse for him. Olaf went to the stable and put the
saddle on a large billy-goat, which he led up to the
door where Sigurd stood waiting. When questioned
as to the meaning of this joke, he replied that the
billy-goat was good enough for Sigurd, who resembled
other kings about as much as the goat resembled
a war-horse.</p>

<p>In his games Olaf was hot-tempered and imperious,
proud of his birth, and determined to assert himself
above every one. At the age of twelve he went on
viking cruises and distinguished himself greatly by
his prowess and daring. He ravaged the coasts of
Sweden in order to avenge his father's death, and
during a cruise to England helped the sons of Ethelred
against the Danes (1008). This wild, roaming
life, with its constant vicissitudes, matured his char<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>acter,
giving him a wide experience of men and
developing his inborn faculty for leadership. The
departure of Earl Erik from Norway in 1015 gave
him the desired opportunity to assert his claim to
the throne, and he lost no time in embarking for the
land of his birth. He proceeded in this matter, however,
with characteristic caution. Knowing that the
sentiment of the people toward him would have to
determine his action, he did not wish to commit
himself without having ascertained beforehand the
chances of success. He therefore left his galleys of
war behind him in England and sailed across the
North Sea with two merchant-ships. As he disembarked,
his foot slipped and he fell upon the beach.</p>

<p>"There, I fell," he cried, dreading, probably, the
bad omen.</p>

<p>"No," answered one of his men, "thou didst plant
thy foot in Norway's soil."</p>

<p>He sailed southward along the coast, no one knowing
him or suspecting his errand. One day, as he was
sitting in his tent on the beach, whittling a spear
handle, a peasant entered and looked hard at him.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am a merchant," said Olaf.</p>

<p>"Likely enough," rejoined the peasant, "art thou
a merchant; but I know the eyes of Olaf Tryggvesson,
and I believe that thou wilt soon meet Earl
Haakon and win a great victory."</p>

<p>"If it be true, as thou sayest," responded the
prince, "thou mayst come to me and thou shalt
profit by my victory."</p>

<p>The shrewdness of Olaf's plan to avoid all warlike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
display was demonstrated by the issue. In Saudung
Sound he succeeded in capturing the young Earl
Haakon, who, without thought of danger, was sailing
along with a single ship and a small retinue.
When Olaf saw him he marvelled at his beauty. The
earl was but seventeen years old, tall, and well
shaped. His hair fell in golden curls upon his
shoulders and shone like silk. About his head he
wore a fillet of gold.</p>

<p>"It is true what is said about you and your race,"
said Olaf, "you are indeed very beautiful. But now
your luck has forsaken you."</p>

<p>"I see no sign that our luck has forsaken us,"
answered the youth proudly; "even if such a thing
as this may happen. It is ever so, that sometimes
the one is victorious and sometimes the other. I
myself am young and inexperienced, and I was expecting
no breach of the peace, and could therefore
make no defence. Another time, perhaps, I shall do
better."</p>

<p>"But art thou not aware," retorted Olaf, "that
from this time forth there can be no question either
of victory or defeat in thy case?"</p>

<p>"That all depends upon you," said the earl, fearlessly.</p>

<p>"What wilt thou do, if I let thee depart unscathed?"</p>

<p>"Let me know what you demand."</p>

<p>"Only this, that thou shalt leave the country and
renounce thy dominion over it. And, moreover,
thou shalt swear an oath that thou wilt never wage
war against me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The earl having no choice agreed to these terms,
and forthwith sailed to his uncle, King Knut, in
England.</p>

<p>Before taking up the combat with Earl Sweyn,
Olaf found it advisable to sound the popular sentiment
and to secure supporters among the powerful
peasants and chieftains. To this end he visited his
step-father, Sigurd Syr, in Ringerike, and asked his
counsel. The story of his reception by his mother,
Aasta, which is circumstantially related by Snorre, is
full of vivid details, and throws a strong light upon
the customs and manners of the age. When the
rumor of her son's approach reached Aasta, she
arose and prepared to give him a fitting reception.
She ordered four maid-servants to drape the walls
with hangings of cloth and likewise to cover the
benches. Tables were put up and an abundance of
food and beer was provided. Messengers were sent
in haste to invite guests from far and near; and each
was requested to appear in his best clothes; and to
those who had no good clothes, fitting apparel was
given. King Sigurd was, as usual, in the field superintending
his laborers. It was just in the midst of
the harvest, and every hour was precious. He wore
a blue tunic, of coarse cloth, blue breeches, high
shoes, a gray cloak, and a broad-brimmed gray hat.
In his hand he carried a staff with a gilt silver head.
When his wife's messengers brought him the tidings
of his step-son's return, he probably did not relish the
interruption. Still less was he pleased with the admonition
which they brought him in her name, that
he prove himself, on this occasion, as a true descend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>ant
of Harold the Fairhaired. He made a little
speech in the field, in which he cloaked his ill-humor
as well as he might. Then he sat down and exchanged
his every-day garments for the splendid
attire which Aasta had sent him. While the field-hands
stood about staring, he pulled on a silken
tunic, breeches to match, and Cordovan boots, with
spurs of gold. A sword of beautiful workmanship
was buckled about his loins, a gilt helmet put upon
his head, and a scarlet cloak hung over his shoulders.
Thus arrayed and with a train of thirty attendants
he sallied forth to meet his step-son. As he rode
down over the fields, he saw Olaf and his train of
120 warriors approaching from the other side. They
marched up into the court-yard with waving banner,
and there Sigurd greeted the returned viking and
welcomed him home. His mother kissed him, invited
him to stay with her as long as he wished,
and placed all that was hers&mdash;land, people, and
money&mdash;at his disposal.</p>

<p>In the family council that was held, after the feast
of welcome was over, Sigurd Syr pledged his aid to
Olaf, and promised to employ his influence in his
favor. On the other hand, he cautioned him to proceed
with prudence, and dissuaded him from measuring
strength with Earl Sweyn, until he had a sufficient
force of adherents. In the end he did not question
his success.</p>

<p>"The multitude," he said, "always love change.
Thus it proved to be, when Olaf Tryggvesson arrived.
All became fond of him, although, to be
sure, he did not long enjoy his kingdom."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>To this the proud Aasta replied that she would
rather have her son die young, after a brief and
glorious career, like Olaf Tryggvesson, than die old,
after a long and deedless one, like Sigurd Syr.</p>

<p>Among the small shire-kings, who lived like rich
landholders in different parts of the Oplands, there
were many who were descendants of Harold the
Fairhaired. All these Sigurd Syr summoned to a
meeting, made them acquainted with Olaf's design,
and begged them to assist in its accomplishment.
One of them, named R&ouml;rek, refused, declaring that
the people and the shire-kings were usually better off
the farther away the overlord was. The kings of
Denmark and Sweden, in whose names the earls had
governed, were very good rulers, because they were
too far away to do much mischief. R&ouml;rek was,
therefore, inclined to let well enough alone, and he
advised the rest to do the same. His brother Ring
spoke in quite a different spirit.</p>

<p>"I would fain once more see our race at the helm
in the land," he said; * * * "if our kinsman, Olaf,
becomes overlord over the kingdom, that man will
be best off who has the greatest claim upon his
friendship."</p>

<p>The other shire-kings were of the same opinion,
and all pledged their kinsman their support. The
people were immediately summoned to a <i>thing</i>, at
which Olaf eloquently affirmed his right to the throne
and was proclaimed king. In return he promised,
according to ancient usage, to rule in accordance
with the laws, and to protect the land against external
enemies. A great multitude of warriors thronged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
forward to enroll themselves under his banner, and
his following became so great as to cause him inconvenience.
For food was not abundant, and the levying
of supplies from the country might easily alienate
the people. Again, if he meant to surprise Earl
Sweyn, who was at that time sojourning at Steinker
in Tr&ouml;ndelag, it was important to attract as little
attention as possible, and to choose unfrequented
routes over mountains and through wildernesses.
Nevertheless, he succeeded in penetrating into Orkdale<a name="FNanchor_A_45" id="FNanchor_A_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_45" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
with about 360 men, and to induce an army
of 900 peasants, which had been sent against him
by Einar Thambarskelver, to swear him allegiance.
Earl Sweyn, hearing of this disaster, fled southward
to Frosten and escaped only by a stratagem from
falling into his pursuer's hands. The Tr&ouml;nders were
now summoned to meet Olaf at the <i>thing</i> and compelled
to recognize him as their king (1015). But
they did this reluctantly, being strongly attached to
the race of the earls of Hlade. Many of the most powerful
chieftains, among them Einar Thambarskelver,
were absent from the <i>thing</i>, preferring to make common
cause with the earl.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_45" id="Footnote_A_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_45"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Orkdale is a part of Tr&ouml;ndelag.</p></div>

<p>In spite of the insecurity of his position, King Olaf
determined to celebrate Christmas in Nidaros, the
town founded by Olaf Tryggvesson, and later known
as Drontheim. The earls, caring little for commerce,
had allowed this trading-post to go to ruin; and of
its former prosperity there was scarcely a vestige
left. Olaf, emphasizing here as ever his r&ocirc;le as the
legitimate heir of his great kinsman, began to repair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the dilapidated houses and arranged himself as well
as he could with his retinue. He might, however,
have saved himself the trouble; for no sooner had
he moved his goods up from the ships than Earl
Sweyn and Einar Thambarskelver descended upon
him in the night with 2,400 men, and would have
made an end of his career, if his sentinels had not
warned him in the nick of time of the impending
danger. He made his escape southward to the Oplands,
where he was again well received by his step-father.
His one endeavor now was to raise an army
large enough to crush his rival. Sigurd Syr's popularity
and influence stood him in good stead, and
many chieftains who had hitherto held aloof were
induced to join him. Among these was Ketil Calf
of Ringeness. The remainder of the winter was
occupied in ship-building and in securing resources
for a decisive campaign. It was at this time that the
great galley "Karlshoved" (Churl's Head) was built,
the prow of which was adorned with a man's head,
which the king himself had carved. In the spring,
as soon as the ice broke up, he sailed out of the
Folden Fjord with about twenty ships and from
1,500 to 2,000 men.</p>

<p>Earl Sweyn, in the meanwhile, had strained all his
powers to meet the emergency. With the aid of
Erling Skjalgsson of Sole and Einar Thambarskelver
he had got together a fleet of forty-five well-equipped
ships, manned with about 3,000 warriors.
With this formidable force he met Olaf at Nessje, a
head-land on the coast of Vestfold. It was Palm
Sunday (March 25, 1016), and, according to the story,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Olaf sent a messenger to the earl requesting him to
grant a truce until the next day. The earl, however,
who had no scruples on account of the holiday,
refused the request, and the battle commenced. As
was the custom in naval battles, the ships were tied
together with ropes, "The Churl's-Head" occupying
the centre and the smaller crafts the extreme wings.
On board the king's ship were 120 picked men, all
clad in ring armor and with French helmets on their
heads. Their shields were white, with crosses of
red or blue or gilt; crosses of the same colors also
adorned their helmets. The king instructed his
men to appear at first to act on the defensive, saving
their spears until the enemy had thrown away theirs.
This stratagem proved effective; for, as the king's
battle-array bore down upon that of the earl, he was
received with a storm of missiles. His men, however,
were only at pains to protect themselves,
thereby redoubling the martial zeal of their opponents,
who imagined they were afraid. Then, when
spears and arrows grew scarce on the earl's side, a
vehement onslaught from the king met with no
adequate resistance. Olaf took advantage of the
momentary surprise to steer up to the earl's ship and
engage him at close quarters. The fight there was
long and bitter, and men fell in heaps on both sides.
At last Earl Sweyn's men began to waver, and one
by one the ships were cut loose and prepared to flee.
But Olaf's men held them fast with boat-hooks until
Sweyn ordered the prows to be cut off; even thus
he would not have escaped with his life, if his
brother-in-law, Einar Thambarskelver, had not flung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
an anchor aboard to him, and by means of the rope
attached to it hauled him out of the line of battle.
For all that, he managed to collect his ships further
out in the fjord, and for a while it looked as if a fresh
attack was imminent. Sigurd Syr urged Olaf not
to let the opportunity escape of utterly destroying
Erling Skjalgsson and Einar Thambarskelver.</p>

<p>"For," said he, "I well foresee that thou with thy
character and ambition, wilt scarcely ever reach the
point, when thou canst trust those magnates who are
accustomed to bid defiance to chieftains."</p>

<p>Before Olaf had time to answer, the earl's fleet suddenly
scattered, and the opportunity for destroying
the chiefs was lost. The king's first act after the
battle was to kneel upon the strand and thank God
for the victory.</p>

<p>Earl Sweyn, though he had yet a large following
and sufficient resources to continue the struggle,
sailed eastward to Sweden where he was well received
by his brother-in-law, King Olaf the Swede.
He seems to have contemplated a fresh campaign
against Norway, and was encouraged by the Swedish
king to avenge his defeat. Instead of that, however,
he undertook during the following summer a warlike
expedition into Russia, probably to replenish his
treasury, was taken ill and died on the way (1016).</p>

<p>Olaf availed himself of the earl's absence to extort
oaths of allegiance from the peasantry along the
coast; he hesitated, however, for some reason to attack
Erling Skjalgsson and passed by the provinces
which he held in fief without landing. He returned
to Nidaros, rebuilt the ruined "king's hall," and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Church of St. Clement. From his sojourn abroad he
had learned a lesson in regard to the advantages of
commercial intercourse, and he encouraged merchants
and artisans to take up their abode in the resuscitated
city. He had small confidence in the good-will of
the Tr&ouml;nders; and therefore liked to surround himself
with men who were free from local ties and traditions.
The death of Earl Sweyn, however, as soon
as the rumor of it reached Norway, changed the
situation. The Tr&ouml;nders, having now no chieftain of
their own, began to send the king friendly messages
and in various ways to court his favor. Presently he
felt himself safe in summoning chiefs and peasantry
to meet him at the <i>thing</i>, and his formal recognition
as king followed in all the shires of Tr&ouml;ndelag. But
it will be remembered that four of these shires, besides
the adjacent provinces of Nordm&ouml;re, Raumsdale,
and S&ouml;ndm&ouml;re, had after the battle of Svolder
been awarded to the king of Sweden, in whose behalf
Earl Sweyn had governed them. A great wrath,
therefore, possessed King Olaf the Swede, when he
heard that the Tr&ouml;nders had sworn allegiance to
"Olaf the Big." This was the nickname which he
had conferred upon his opponent on account of his
stoutness and burly frame. He could never refer to
him except with oaths and opprobrious terms. His
threats and insults, however, brought no response,
and finally he determined to send a party of tax-gatherers
into his former provinces. Having vainly
solicited the tax, they sought an audience with King
Olaf, who commanded them to go home and invite
the King of Sweden to meet him at the boundary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
between the two countries. "Then," he said, "he
may, if he chooses, come to an agreement with me,
on the condition that each keeps the kingdom to
which his birthright entitles him."</p>

<p>Twelve of the tax-gatherers who ventured to disobey
his command, were captured and hanged. Such
an insult the Swedish king could not allow to pass
unavenged, and Olaf made preparations to receive
him. He built a rude fortress on a headland projecting
into the river Glommen, near the cataract
Sarpen. In connection with these fortifications he
founded a city called Borg or Sarpsborg, built a
"king's hall," and offered protection to traders who
came to settle there. The expected invasion from
Sweden would naturally be directed through this
district, and the site of the new city was therefore
chosen chiefly for its strategic value. For a while,
however, no decisive action was taken by the king of
Sweden, who contented himself with killing Olaf's
tax-gatherers in Jemteland in retaliation. The fact
was that the feud was purely a personal one between
the two kings, while their subjects, having no grudge
against each other, desired peace. The king's friend
and marshal, Bj&ouml;rn Stallare, was induced to speak in
the people's cause, and was finally commissioned to
go as Olaf's embassador to Sweden, proposing peace
on the conditions already named. But this embassy
involved great danger, as Olaf the Swede, in his fury,
did not even permit the name of his enemy to be
mentioned in his presence. Bj&ouml;rn therefore sent his
friend, the Icelander, Hjalte Skeggesson, in advance
to prepare the way for him, while he himself tarried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
with Ragnvald, the earl of Vesterg&ouml;tland, who
had married the sister of Olaf Tryggvesson. Ragnvald's
foster-father was the mighty peasant, Thorgny
Thorgnysson, the law-man.<a name="FNanchor_A_46" id="FNanchor_A_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_46" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> By securing the friendship
of the earl, Bj&ouml;rn accordingly assured himself of
protection, in case the king should attempt violence
against him. At the great winter <i>thing</i> in Upsala,
where the king was present, he suddenly rose out
of the throng of the people and said in a loud voice;
so that all could hear him: "King Olaf sends me
hither to offer the king of Sweden peace and the
boundary which from ancient times has been between
Norway and Sweden."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_46" id="Footnote_A_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_46"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> <i>Laga-madr</i> is not a lawyer in the modern sense, but rather a kind
of judge. The office had a slightly different significance in Sweden
from what it acquired in Norway when introduced there by King
Sverre.</p></div>

<p>When Olaf the Swede heard the name of King
Olaf, he first supposed that the speaker referred to
himself; but when he began to see the connection,
he rose and called out, in great wrath, that the man
who was speaking should be silent, as such speech
would not be tolerated. Bj&ouml;rn then sat down; but
instantly Earl Ragnvald arose and said that his
people had suffered greatly from the interruption of
commercial intercourse with Norway, and were all
of opinion that the king should accept the proposal
of Olaf the Big; and, as guaranty of peace, give him
his daughter, Ingegerd, in marriage. The king, on
hearing this, declared, angrily, that he would hear
of no peace; he called the earl a traitor who deserved
to be driven out of the country, and berated
him for having married a woman who sympathized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>with the king's enemies. In the hope that the matter
would now be dropped, he resumed his seat.
Then up rose Thorgny the Lawman. He was very
large of stature, gray-haired, and broad-chested, and
his beard fell like a cataract down to his girdle. The
moment he was on his feet, the people thronged forward
with great noise and rattle of arms. "Quite
different are the kings of Sweden now," Thorogny
began, "from what they were in earlier times.
Thorgny, my grandfather, could remember Erik
Eimundsson, and told of him that, while he was
in his best years, he went in warfare every summer
to different lands, and subjugated Finnland, Karelen,
Esthonia, Kurland, and many other eastern lands.
Men may yet see the earthworks and other great enterprises
he undertook; and yet he was not too
proud to listen to people who had necessary things
to say to him. Thorgny, my father, was for a long
time with King Bj&ouml;rn, and knew his manner of behaving.
In Bj&ouml;rn's time, the kingdom was very
powerful and suffered no loss; he was very easy to
get along with, to his friends. I can myself remember
King Erik the Victorious, and I was with him in
many a war. He increased the realm of the Swedes
and bravely defended it. He, too, accepted good
counsel from us. But this king whom we now have
will suffer no man to speak to him, unless he speaks
that which he likes. This he insists upon with all
his might; but he suffers provinces to be lost for
want of briskness and enterprise. He wishes to
conquer the realm of Norway&mdash;a thing which no
Swedish king has hitherto desired,&mdash;and this causes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
many a man disquietude. Now, it is the wish of us,
the peasants, that thou, King Olaf, makest peace
with Olaf the Big, the King of Norway, and
givest him thy daughter, Ingegerd, in marriage.
* * * If thou wilt not consent to this, then
we will attack thee and kill thee, and no longer
suffer breach of the peace and breach of law from
thee. Thus our forefathers did in days of old. They
flung five kings down into a swamp at the Mora
<i>thing</i>, because they were too inflated with pride&mdash;just
as thou art. Tell us now, in this hour, which of
these conditions thou wilt choose."</p>

<p>The peasants signified loudly, by rattle of arms,
their approval of this sentiment; and the king, quite
overawed, rose and said that he would yield and let
the peasants have their way in this matter. The
conditions of peace were thus accepted, and the time
for the wedding was fixed. Bj&ouml;rn and his men returned
to Norway and received valuable gifts from
King Olaf, for having successfully accomplished
a difficult mission. Unhappily, however, the
Swedish king, as soon as the danger was removed,
began to reconsider his promise; and it gave him, no
doubt, satisfaction to hear of his enemy's discomfort
when, after vainly waiting for his bride on the
boundary, he returned to Sarpsborg (1018). It did
not occur to him that his own subjects, who had demanded
the cessation of hostilities, might resent his
undignified trick; and he was both surprised and
alarmed when a revolt broke out, which came very
near costing him his crown. Once more he had to
make concessions, promise to make peace with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
king of Norway, and accept his twelve-year-old son,
Anund Jacob, as co-regent. King Olaf, of Norway,
had, in the meanwhile, contrary to the will of
her father, married Aastrid, a younger sister of
Ingegerd. At the peace of Konghelle (1019), where
the two kings finally met, this marriage was recognized
by the king of Sweden, and friendly relations
were established. The province of Jemteland remained
in the possession of Olaf of Norway.</p>

<p>This is the first time that Norway, as an integral
kingdom, treats with a foreign power. The kings of
Sweden and Denmark who claimed descent from
Ragnar Lodbrok and through him from the gods,
had never until now recognized the descendants of
Harold the Fairhaired as rulers of a united realm
and their own equals in dignity. Norway was to
them merely a collection of small, scattered communities
which, having once been united, made haste
to fall to pieces again, and had at different times
recognized the overlordship of the kings of Sweden
and Denmark. The reluctance of the Swedish king
to give his daughter in marriage to Olaf Haroldsson
is therefore quite comprehensible.</p>

<p>Olaf Haroldsson was, undoubtedly, the first king,
since Harold the Fairhaired, who had any clear conception
of a national unity. The thought may have
been present in the mind of Olaf Trygvesson, but he
died too soon to carry it out. Olaf Haroldsson, on
the other hand, set to work with deliberate purpose
to unite all Norway under the cross of Christ. With
300 armed men he travelled from shire to shire, and
severely punished those who secretly or openly sacri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>ficed
to the old gods or indulged in any pagan practice.
Some were outlawed and their property
confiscated, others were maimed, and a few hanged
or beheaded. Fugitives spread the report of the
king's violence; and alarm and resentment filled the
minds of all who were yet devoted to the Asa faith.
Five shire-kings in the Oplands, all of whom had
given allegiance to Olaf, formed a conspiracy, under
the leadership of King R&ouml;rek, to murder him. But
Ketil Calf of Ringeness got wind of their purpose,
and hastened with the tidings to Olaf, who crossed
the lake Mj&ouml;sen in the night, surprised the conspirators,
and captured them. R&ouml;rek was blinded, Gudr&ouml;d,
the king of Hadeland and Raumarike, had his
tongue cut out, and the others were punished with
similar severity. The death of Sigurd Syr (1018)
called Olaf to Ringerike where he spent some days
arranging the affairs of his widowed mother. Aasta
had three sons by Sigurd Syr&mdash;Guttorm, Halfdan,
and Harold. These she brought into the hall to
make them acquainted with their half-brother, the
king. Olaf, it is told, put Guttorm and Halfdan on
his knees, and made such a fierce face at them that
they grew frightened and ran away. He then took
the youngest boy, Harold, and stared at him with
the same stern expression. The boy, instead of running
away, made a face as stern as the king's and
stared back at him. Olaf, to test him further, pulled
his hair; but Harold, nothing daunted, retaliated by
pulling the king's beard. The next day Olaf and
Aasta stood watching the boys at play. Guttorm
and Halfdan had built barns and stables, and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
figures representing cows and sheep; while Harold
had started a fleet of chips and shavings on a pond,
and delighted in seeing them drift before the wind.
The king asked him what they were meant to represent.</p>

<p>"Ships of war," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"I should not wonder, kinsman," said Olaf, "if
some day thou wouldst command ships of war."</p>

<p>Guttorm was now called and asked what he
desired most of all.</p>

<p>"Land," he replied.</p>

<p>"How much?" asked the king.</p>

<p>"I wish," said the boy, "to sow as much every
summer as would cover the headland that sticks out
into the water there."</p>

<p>The headland included ten large farms.</p>

<p>"Much grain could grow there," observed the
king.</p>

<p>Halfdan declared that what he wished most of all
was cows, and so many of them that in drinking
they would cover the shores of Guttorm's headland.</p>

<p>"But what do you wish, Harold?" asked Olaf,
turning to the youngest boy.</p>

<p>"Men,"<a name="FNanchor_A_47" id="FNanchor_A_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_47" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> answered Harold.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_47" id="Footnote_A_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_47"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The word used is <i>hus-karler, i. e.</i>, house-carles, retainers.
What the boy meant to say was that he wished to have men under his
command.</p></div>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"So many that they would in a single meal eat up
all my brother Halfdan's cattle."</p>

<p>"There, mother," said Olaf, laughing, as he turned
to Aasta, "thou art fostering a king."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p><p>This prophecy was verified, for Harold Sigurdsson
became king of Norway.</p>

<p>From Ringerike Olaf went southward to Tunsberg,
where he intended to celebrate Easter. He
carried the blind King R&ouml;rek with him, and seemed
inclined by kindness to make him forget his hard
fate. He gave him servants and money and the
seat at table next to his own. But R&ouml;rek could not
forget that he was of the race of Harold the Fairhaired,
and that he had once been king. For a long
while he disguised his feelings, appearing careless
and jolly, while in his heart he was nursing plans of
vengeance. First he induced his servant, Sweyn, to
attempt the life of the king. But when in the critical
moment the king looked hard at him, Sweyn
grew pale, fell at Olaf's feet, and implored forgiveness.
From that time R&ouml;rek was no longer allowed
to sit at the king's table; but he continued to be well
treated, although he had to submit to the company
of two keepers, who were made responsible for his
actions. These he killed by the aid of his friends,
and made a futile effort to regain his liberty. But
even after he had been brought back, the king took
no vengeance upon him. On Ascension Day, 1018,
Olaf attended mass, and R&ouml;rek accompanied him.
When Olaf knelt down, the blind man laid his hands
upon his shoulder, saying: "Thou hast ermine on
to-day, kinsman." "Yes," said the king, "for to-day
we celebrate a great festival in memory of Christ's
ascent from earth to heaven."</p>

<p>"You tell me so much about Christ," said R&ouml;rek,
"which I don't understand, and therefore can't re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>member;
although, to be sure, many incredible things
may have happened in ancient times."</p>

<p>When the mass commenced, Olaf arose, raised his
hands above his head, and bowed toward the altar,
so that his cloak fell from his shoulders. Swift as a
flash R&ouml;rek sprang forward and made a lunge with
his dagger at the place where the king had stood.
The cloak was rent in twain, but the forward inclination
of the king's body saved him. R&ouml;rek made a
second thrust, but Olaf had by this time rushed out
upon the floor, and was beyond his reach.</p>

<p>"Fleest thou now, Olaf the Big," shouted R&ouml;rek,
"from me who am blind?"</p>

<p>He had put his hand on the king's shoulder merely
to feel if he wore armor. The would-be murderer
was now seized, but though many urged him, Olaf
refused to put him to death. Being, however, compelled
to protect himself from his machinations, he
sent R&ouml;rek to Iceland, where, a few years later, he
died. All the shire-kings had now lost their power,
and for the first time in the history of Norway, no
one had royal title in all the country except the king.
It was as the representatives of a narrow local
patriotism, which was shared by a large number of
the people, that these men had been formidable, and to
weld all the scattered tribes into one nation would have
been impossible, without first breaking their power.
But as has already been observed, to break their
power, as long as the Asa faith was the national
religion, was out of the question; because the old
tribal chieftainships embraced also the priesthoods,
and the hereditary dignity of the local priest-kings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
was thus hallowed by all the religious as well as the
political traditions of the tribe. King Olaf's zeal
for the Christianization of the country had, therefore,
its political as well as its religious aspect; and it was no
mere coincidence that he directed his energy simultaneously
against the old gods and the men who derived
the chief benefit from their worship. During<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the years of peace from 1020-1026 he devoted himself
with unflagging ardor to this task of eradicating
every vestige of heathenism, and bringing the laws
and institutions of the land into conformity with the
religion of Christ. It was a noble task and, if we
overlook a certain tendency to violence which was in
the spirit of the age, nobly performed. To perform
it completely would have been a superhuman labor.
The ideals and sentiments of men, of which their institutions
are but the expression, do not change radically
in the course of one or two generations. There are
traces of a gradual change of sentiment, even before
the days of Olaf Haroldsson, in favor of gentler and
more peaceful ideals. Not only by bloody deeds was
honor acquired, but a man could by just and honorable
conduct, and particularly by insight into the
law, make for himself a respected position, even if he
was reluctant to unsheath the sword. Instances of
this kind are, however, rare, and to draw general inferences
from them would be hazardous. War was
the Norseman's occupation, and his gods were war-gods.
A life full of warlike achievements, and after
death an honorable fame, he had been taught to regard
as the worthiest objects of aspiration. Asceticism
and humility he looked upon with pitying disdain,
and the sublimity of self-sacrificing suffering, as
revealed in Christ, could scarcely appeal to him. A
god who consented to be slain by his enemies must
have appeared to him quite an incomprehensible being,
whose feebleness contrasted strikingly with the grandeur
of the thundering Thor. The joys of Valhalla,
the <i>valkyrias</i> with the mead-horns, the daily diet of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
pork, the exhilarating tumult of never-ending combat,
and the glorious companionship with departed
heroes, were in conformity with the ideas of happiness
which his life and training had fostered; while
the Christian heaven, with its prospect of unending
praise, in the company of saints who had no taste
for fight or craving for honor, must, by comparison,
have appeared ineffably dreary. It is told of a
Frisian chieftain, who was about to be baptized, that
he suddenly turned to the priest and asked him where
his brave forefathers were who had died unbaptized.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus231.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="KNIVES OF IRON FOUND IN HEDEMARKEN AND HADELAND." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">KNIVES OF IRON FOUND IN HEDEMARKEN AND HADELAND.</span>
</div>

<p>"They are in hell," answered the priest.</p>

<p>"Then," said the chief, flinging off his baptismal
robe and stepping out of the water, "I will rather
be in hell with Odin and my forefathers, who were
brave and noble men, than in heaven with cowardly
Christians and bald-headed monks."</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that the relapse into paganism
which followed the death of Olaf Tryggvesson was
what might have been expected; and the general reaction
against the new faith which set in during the
reign of the earls was also quite natural. Olaf,
Haroldsson, therefore, had, in a large measure, to
do the work of his kinsman over again, and he did it
with such energy that, in the end, he forced the
expiring Asa faith, and the tribal magnates who
founded their power upon it, into a mortal combat
in which he himself succumbed, while the religion
of Christ rose from his tomb, victorious.</p>

<p>King Olaf was by nature well equipped for his
mission. He had a robust frame, indomitable will,
and great endurance. There was something in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
very build and look which indicated that he was not
to be trifled with. It was not the youthful enthusiasm
of an Olaf Tryggvesson which inspired his
measures for the propagation of the faith; but
rather a firm, dogged determination to accomplish
a task, the moral and political importance of which
had strongly impressed him. We need not question
his sincerity because in serving God he also served
himself. All his habits and actions seem to show
that he was by conviction and temperament a religious
man. But a fanatic he was not; and the
legends which in later times clustered about his
name have, by attributing to him an undue ardor,
distorted his image. He was, in spite of his later
sainthood, a strong-willed, ambitious, and worldly-wise
man; far-seeing in his plans, business-like in
his methods, relentless in his hates, ruthless in his
punishments. And yet, as we have seen him in his
treatment of R&ouml;rek, he was by no means devoid of
pity, and could, when occasion demanded, show himself
magnanimous.</p>

<p>His severity, which the sagas comment upon, was
never wanton; but was in proportion to the magnitude
of the offence. Robbers, thieves, and vikings
who plundered within the land he punished with
death, no matter whether their birth was high or
low; because the extirpation of the old predatory
spirit with its internecine feuds was the first condition
for the establishment of a united nationality.</p>

<p>In appearance King Olaf was of middle height,
large-limbed, broad-necked, of florid complexion,
and inclined to corpulence. He wore a full red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
beard, and his eyes were piercing and of great
brilliancy. In spite of his stoutness, he was brisk
in his motions and of active habits. He was a good
judge of men, and staunch in his friendship to those
who did him faithful service. He selected Bishop
Grimkel, an Englishman, though probably of Norse
blood, to elaborate a Christian law, and revise the
previous legislation so as to bring it into accord with
the teaching of Christ. Although himself no scholar,
he valued theological learning, and showed great
favor to the priests whom he brought over from
England to instruct the people. Such instruction
was indeed needed; for during the journeys which
the king undertook through the length and breadth
of the land for the purpose of "inquiring into the
condition of Christianity," he made the most disheartening
discoveries. During his sojourn in Nidaros
he ascertained that the Tr&ouml;nders, in spite of
their assertions to the contrary, were in the habit of
celebrating the old pagan festivals and offering up
sacrifices to Odin and Frey for good crops. The
chieftain, Oelve of Egge, who had twice deceived
the king in regard to the practices of the peasants,
and himself participated in them, was slain, and a
great number of others who had been similarly guilty
were killed, maimed, or outlawed, and their estates
confiscated. In Guldbrandsdale the peasants had the
hardihood to send eight hundred armed men against
the king, under the leadership of Alf, son of Dale-Guldbrand,
the first chieftain in the valley. The
battle was, however, scarcely opened when the peasants
fled, and Dale-Guldbrand invited Olaf to hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<i>thing</i> with them and deliberate concerning the change
of faith. To the king's request that the men of Guldbrandsdale
should believe in the one God and be baptized,
Dale-Guldbrand replied:</p>

<p>"We know not of whom thou art speaking; for
thou callest him a god whom neither thou canst see
nor any one else. I cannot ask help of any one
whom I do not see or know. Then we have a very
different kind of god whom we can look at every
day. The reason why he is not out to-day is that it
is raining so hard. But I dare say that when you get
sight of him you will be frightened, nay, quite terrified
because of his might. But if there is any truth
in what thou sayest, that thy God is so powerful,
then let him arrange it so that to-morrow we shall
have cloudy weather but no rain."</p>

<p>The next morning the <i>thing</i> again met, and the
sky was overcast, but no drop of rain fell. The
king ordered the mass to be celebrated by Bishop
Sigurd, who preached to the peasants about the miracles
which Christ had wrought when he was on earth.
On the third day the people again came to the
<i>thing</i>, this time bearing a great image of the god
Thor, which they placed upon the green. The
weather was still cloudy, but without rain. From
out of the throng of the peasants Dale-Guldbrand
arose and said:</p>

<p>"Where is now thy god, king? He wears his
chin beard pretty low now, and methinks that thou
art not so bold as thou wast yesterday, nor is the
horned man at thy side who is called the bishop.
For now our god has come who rules over all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
things, and he is looking at you with his fierce eyes.
I see now that you are full of fear and scarcely dare
look into his eyes. Therefore give up your folly
and believe in our god who holds your fate in his
hand."</p>

<p>To this the king replied:</p>

<p>"Many things thou hast spoken to us this day,
and thou art wondering that thou canst not see our
God. But I think he will soon come to us. Thou
wishest to frighten us with thy god, who is both
deaf and blind, and can save neither himself nor
others; who cannot stir from the spot unless he is
carried. Now I have a foreboding that he will soon
come to grief. For, behold! Look eastward!
There our God is coming with much light,"</p>

<p>Just at that moment the sun burst through the
clouds, and the peasants all turned toward the east.
But instantly Kolbj&ouml;rn the Strong, at a sign from
the king, struck the idol with his club, so that it
burst into many pieces. Out leaped rats as big as
cats, snakes, and lizards, which had fattened on the
delicacies with which the god had daily been fed. A
terrible consternation seized the peasants when they
saw what their god contained. They fled to the river;
but Olaf, who had foreseen this, had bored holes in
their boats so that they were unable to float them.
Quite subdued in spirit, they were compelled to return
to the <i>thing</i>-meadow, where the king addressed them
in these words: * * * "Now you see what
power there was in your god, to whom you bore silver
and gold and bread and meat, and who it was
that enjoyed it all. It was mice and snakes, vipers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and toads. * * * Take now your gold and ornaments,
which lie scattered on the ground, and bring
them home to your wives, but hang them no more
on logs and stones. Now I will give you the choice
of two things. Either you shall accept the Christian
faith or you shall fight with me this day. He will
win to whom the god in whom we trust will give
victory."</p>

<p>The peasants were in no mood to fight; and therefore,
after the discomfiture of their god, declared
their faith in Christ and were baptized by the king's
bishop. Priests were left behind to instruct them, and
Dale-Guldbrand built the first church in Guldbrandsdale.</p>

<p>After having with the same firm hand put down
paganism in Hedemarken and Raumarike, Olaf
called a great <i>thing</i> at Eidsvold, where the Eidsivia
law was proclaimed and adopted for all the Oplands.
It was his intention to revise the laws of all the
judicial districts in the same spirit, and he naturally
turned his attention to the western coast-shires,
which belonged under the jurisdiction of the <i>Gula-thing's</i>
law. But these shires were part of Erling
Skjalgsson's fief, which extended from Lindesness
to the Sogne Fjord. Having small faith in Erling's
friendship, which on a previous occasion had been
pledged to him, Olaf prepared to travel with a large
force through his shires; and as the crops had partly
failed in the northern shires, he forbade all exportation
of grain from the districts which he meant to
traverse. This was merely a measure of self-protection,
and though oppressive in its effect, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
prompted by no unfriendly motive. Erling's
nephew, the young chief Aasbj&ouml;rn Sigurdsson, of
Haalogaland, in spite of the prohibition, with the
connivance of his uncle, bought malt and grain of
the latter's thralls, and was in consequence deprived
of his cargo by the king's steward, Thore Sel, at
Agvaldsness. In return for this he killed the steward
in the king's presence, was seized, and sentenced
to death, but forcibly liberated by his uncle. Enraged
by this unexampled audacity, the king came
near taking summary vengeance upon Erling, but
allowed himself to be persuaded by Bishop Sigurd
to make peace, on condition that Aasbj&ouml;rn should
surrender himself to his mercy. The second sentence
was, however, according to the notions of
those days, severer than the first. Olaf demanded
of the young chief that he should perform the service
of the man he had slain. Any personal service, even
under a king, was held to be degrading and unworthy
of a freeman. The royal stewards were usually men
of low birth; sometimes even thralls or sons of
thralls. For a man of illustrious lineage to take the
place of such a minion would be tantamount to accepting
a badge of servitude. Aasbj&ouml;rn, therefore,
broke his promise, relying upon Erling Skjalgsson,
and his father's brother, the powerful Thore Hund
of Bjark&ouml;, to shield him from the king's vengeance.
In this, however, he made a miscalculation. For
one day, as he was sailing in his fine ship along the
coast, another ship passed him, from which a spear
was hurled forth that transfixed him. This spear
was thrown by a friend of the king. Aasbj&ouml;rn's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
mother, Sigrid, made a great funeral feast over her
son, and gave each of the guests gifts by which to
remember him. Only Thore Hund of Bjark&ouml; received
no gift. But when the time came for departing,
Sigrid accompanied him down to his ship and
gave him a spear inscribed with strange runes.</p>

<p>"This spear it was," she said, "which pierced my
son Aasbj&ouml;rn. It is yet sticky with his blood. * * *
It would be a brave deed, if thou didst part with this
spear in such wise that it stuck in the heart of Olaf
the Big, and I declare thee as a nithing before all
men, if thou dost not avenge Aasbj&ouml;rn."</p>

<p>Thore Hund remembered this injunction, six years
later, at the battle of Stiklestad.</p>

<p>There could now no longer be any question of
peace between Olaf and the race of Erling Skjalgsson.
A decisive conflict was inevitable, and each
party began to make preparations for utterly crushing
the other. King Knut the Mighty, of England
and Denmark, took advantage of this state of things,
and by bribes and promises encouraged the discontented
chieftains throughout the land to unite in revolt
against the tyrannical king. Secret messengers
from Knut were sent with presents to nearly all the
heads of the tribal aristocracy, and the friendliest
reception awaited those of them who went to England.
Two of Erling Skjalgsson's sons, who visited
Knut in London, were quite dazzled by the splendor
and friendliness of the English king. In thus maturing
the revolt, Knut's first purpose was to punish
Olaf for his insolence in refusing to consider his claim
to Norway, which in an embassy (1024) he had threat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>ened
to enforce. Secondly, it tallied well with his
ambitious dream of uniting England and the three
Scandinavian countries in one grand monarchy, which
in the north might counterbalance the German and
French power in the south.</p>

<p>Olaf did not long remain ignorant of King Knut's
machinations; and he took immediate measures to
protect himself. He spent the winter (1025-1026) in
Sarpsborg, and not, as usual, in Nidaros; for he had
learned that Knut was in Denmark and contemplated
an invasion of Norway. Viken, being the province
nearest Denmark, and having formerly belonged to
the Danish kings, would naturally be exposed to the
first attack. In order to strengthen himself further,
he entered into an alliance with his brother-in-law,
the Swedish King Anund Jacob, impressing upon
him the probability that his own turn would come
next, in case Knut gained possession of Norway.
When Knut heard of this, he too sent an embassy to
Anund Jacob, for the purpose of winning his friendship,
or at least secure his neutrality. The embassadors
supported their arguments with splendid gifts;
and King Anund was no doubt sorely tempted to
listen to them. First they put two candlesticks of
gold on the table.</p>

<p>"A very pretty toy is that," said Anund, "but I
will not, in order to get it, break with Olaf."</p>

<p>A golden platter of rare workmanship, and set
with jewels, was placed before him. He gazed longingly
at it; but finally cried out: "A glorious treasure
is that; but I will not sell King Olaf for a dish."</p>

<p>The spokesman of the embassy, talking eagerly in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
his master's behalf, at last pulled out two gorgeous
rings.</p>

<p>"King Knut has much shrewdness," ejaculated
Anund, "for he knows that I would fain win treasure,
and that I know little of courtly custom. But
King Olaf I have known since I was a boy, and
learned to love him so much, that I cannot now forsake
him."</p>

<p>Possibly it was this staunch attitude of Anund
Jacob which discouraged Knut from waging open
war against Olaf. At all events he went (1026) as
a pilgrim to Rome, not as conqueror to Norway.
In the meanwhile, his brother-in-law, Earl Ulf,<a name="FNanchor_A_48" id="FNanchor_A_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_48" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
headed a rebellion against him in Denmark, and
entered into an alliance with Olaf Haroldsson and
Anund Jacob. Both thought this a convenient opportunity
for striking a blow at the threatening
power of Knut, and gathered a fleet with which they
ravaged the coasts of Halland and Skaane. They even
in some places summoned the people to the <i>thing</i> and
received their homage. These tidings reached Knut
who promptly returned from his pilgrimage, and
came within a hair of capturing the two kings who
did not suspect that he was near. Knut's ships were
so greatly superior both in size, number, and equipment,
that it would have been folly to remain and
await battle. Olaf and Anund, therefore, hastened
along the coast of Skaane toward Swedish territory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
hotly pursued by Knut. They put up in the Helge-aa,
a short river, uniting a series of lakes, near what
was then the boundary between Sweden and Denmark.
Olaf made haste to dam up the river where it
issued from the lake, and filled the river-bed with a
mass of trees and other obstructions. Late in the afternoon
Knut sailed into the harbor, and found it deserted.
The allies lay with their fleet outside the harbor,
apparently ready for battle. It was, however, too
late in the day to begin the fight, and Knut left part
of his fleet outside to watch them. In the night the
command was given to break the dam, and an enormous
volume of water rushed down upon the Danish
and English fleet, which broke from its moorings, and
drifted seaward in disorder. A considerable number
of people were drowned, but the ships though
much damaged were not wrecked. The confusion
was, on the whole, less than had been anticipated,
and Earl Ulf, seeing that there was a chance that
Knut might save himself, turned traitor once more
and went to his rescue. The Swedes and the Norsemen,
perceiving that the Danish king with this
accession of strength was too formidable, sailed away
without making an attack (1027). Knut, instead of
pursuing them further, sailed back to England,
but in the following year returned with a greatly increased
force. He had by his extensive system of
bribes effectually secured the friendship of the disaffected
Norse chiefs, and therefore steered without
hesitation to Nidaros where he was proclaimed king
of Norway. He appointed his nephew Earl Haakon,
the son of Earl Erik, regent in his absence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_48" id="Footnote_A_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_48"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Ulf Jarl, the ancestor of a long line of Danish kings, was the
grandson of Thyra, the sister of Sweyn Forkbeard, by her first
husband the Swedish Prince Styrbj&ouml;rn. He was, accordingly, through
his grandmother, a descendant of Gorm the Old, and of Ragnar
Lodbrok.</p></div>

<p>For Olaf there was now really nothing to do but
to leave the country. He determined, however, to
make a last effort to maintain himself and sailed with
a few ships, and as many men as remained faithful
to him, up along the coast, hoping that he might yet
be able to rally a sufficient force to expel Earl
Haakon. When Erling Skjalgsson heard of his approach,
he called together his household troops, and
manned his fleet. The king, however, who had no
desire to fight with Erling, had already slipped by,
but was no further in advance than that he could
easily be overtaken. Erling, accordingly, started in
pursuit, but allowed himself by a stratagem to be
separated from his main force, and after a heroic
fight lost all his men and was captured by Olaf. As
he stood alone among a heap of the slain, his gray
locks falling down over his shoulders, the king called
to him:</p>

<p>"Thou settest thy face straight against us to-day,
Erling." "Face to face do eagles fight," answered
Erling; "wilt thou give me peace?"</p>

<p>Olaf, after some deliberation, declared that he
would; but on second thought half repented of his
generosity. He took his axe and gently scratched
the old man's cheek, saying: "Something must be
done to mark the traitor to his king."</p>

<p>One of the king's men who stood by suddenly
raised his axe and cleft Erling's skull, saying:</p>

<p>"This is the way to mark a traitor to his king."</p>

<p>Thus died the mightiest chieftain in all Norway. No
representative of the tribal aristocracy, before or since,
ever possessed such power as Erling Skjalgsson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Olaf continued his voyage northward to S&ouml;ndm&ouml;re
where a great number of his followers left
him, while at the news of Erling's death enemies
blocked his way wherever he turned. He saw that
his last hope was gone; and with a few friends fled
through Valdalen across the mountains into Sweden,
where he left his wife and daughter. Thence he travelled
to Russia (1029), where he was warmly welcomed
by his brother-in-law, King Jaroslav, who had
married Ingegerd, the sister of Anund Jacob.</p>

<p>Norway was now a province of a foreign power.
The separatistic tendencies of the old tribal magnates
had triumphed over the national idea represented
by King Olaf. It was they and not King
Knut who, in order to gratify their own greed for
power, had destroyed the national unity. In order
to secure their own independence, each in his own
shire, they sacrificed the national independence. It
was natural that Knut, who based his dominion upon
their support, should make them large concessions.
He flattered Einar Thambarskelver, hinting that if
Earl Haakon had not been his nephew he would
have made Einar regent of Norway. Kalf Arnesson,
the mightiest chief among the In-Tr&ouml;nders, he called
over to England and assured him, too, that he was
the man for the earl's place. For Earl Haakon, he
said, was too conscientious to break his oath to Olaf
Haroldsson, in case the latter should return and attempt
to regain his kingdom. It may have been
true that he vaguely distrusted the earl; for on a
slight pretext he summoned him to England and
sent him on an expedition, the nature of which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
not entirely clear. From this expedition, however,
Earl Haakon never returned, and it was reported that
he had been drowned at sea with all his men. Bj&ouml;rn
Stallare, Olaf's friend, hastened to Russia with this
intelligence, and found his old master at King Jaroslav's
court. Olaf asked him for tidings of home, and
how his friends had kept their oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>"Some well and some poorly," answered Bj&ouml;rn,
and threw himself at the king's feet, embracing his
knees; "every thing is in God's power and in yours,
king. I have received money from Knut's men and
sworn him allegiance; but now I will follow thee and
not forsake thee as long as we are both alive."</p>

<p>"Few men have remained faithful to me in
Norway," said the king, sadly, "when such men
as thou art have been led astray. * * *"</p>

<p>He was not at first ready to accept Bj&ouml;rn's invitation
to return to his kingdom. In his forced inactivity
a resolution had half matured in his mind to
become a monk and go on a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land. An offer from Jaroslav to accept a Russian
province in fief he declined. Religious meditations
occupied much of his time; and he acquired the
reputation of being a holy man. While in this
frame of mind, he had a vision in which he saw
Olaf Tryggvesson who commanded him to go back
to Norway and conquer it or die. He could now no
longer hesitate. Much against the advice of Jaroslav
and Ingegerd, he started out for Norway, leaving
his young son Magnus at the Russian court. In
Sweden he received permission from King Anund
to collect whatever recruits he could; but while he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>accepted robbers and outlaws, if they would only be
baptized, he had the courage to reject large bands of
brave men who refused to renounce paganism.</p>

<span class="caption">ST. OLAF, FROM THE ANTEPENDIUM OF THE ALTAR IN DRONTHEIM
CATHEDRAL. REMOVED 1691 TO COPENHAGEN.</span>
</div>

<p>Tradition has preserved with minute fidelity a
number of incidents of King Olaf's progress through
Sweden to the fatal field of Vaerdalen. There is a
melancholy radiance, as of the setting sun, about his
figure as he returns with the gospel of Christ to his
people who had rejected him. First, Bishop Sigurd
came to meet him and strongly dissuaded him from
entering his kingdom. But he would listen to no
remonstrance. Through forests and wildernesses he
broke his way; cheerful amid the greatest hardships,
encouraging his people and never showing, except on
a single occasion, the foreboding that cast its shadow
over his soul. When he crossed the mountains between
Norway and Sweden, and he caught the first
glimpse of the land of his birth with its rivers, mountains,
and sunny valleys, he reined his horse and sat
gazing, lost in thought, on the beautiful sight. A
profound sadness was expressed in his features. At
last the bishop roused him from his reverie, asking
him what he was thinking.</p>

<p>"Strange things," answered the king, "have for a
while been borne past me. It seemed to me, as if I
looked not only out over Drontheim, but over all
Norway; and the longer the vision lasted, the wider
it grew, until I surveyed the whole world, both land
and ocean. Then it seemed to me that I recognized
all the places where I had ever been before; even as
plainly I saw places where I had never been before;&mdash;nay
even some of which I had never even heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>&mdash;both
inhabited and uninhabited, as far as the world
goes."</p>

<p>It is then told that the bishop, dismounting from
his horse and embracing the king's foot, said: "It is
a holy man whom we are following."</p>

<p>Among the few Norsemen of rank who had joined
Olaf before he crossed the boundary, was his half-brother
Harold, the son of Sigurd Syr. He was only
fifteen years old, but large for his age. He led 720
men under his banner. When the king's entire army
was mustered, the day before the battle, it was found
to number 4,100 men; but 500 of these were sent
away because they were heathen, and many of them
no doubt joined the hostile army. The king woke
early on the morning of the battle, and called the
poet, Thormod Kolbruna-Scald, and asked him to
sing to him. Thormod stood up and sang with a ringing
voice the ancient Bjarkemaal, which resounded
over forest and field. The army woke and was arranged
in battle array on the heights of Stiklestad
in Vaerdalen; the peasant army, 10,000 strong
being seen approaching in the distance. With the
battle-cry: "Forward, Christ's men, Crusaders, the
King's men!" Olaf's warriors rushed down the hill-sides,
and the peasant army stormed to meet them
with the cry: "Forward, forward, peasant-men!"
The fight was long indecisive, though the king's men,
on account of the advantage of their position, had the
upper hand in the first onset. The peasants, however,
fought with dogged determination, and their superior
number told, the longer the battle raged.
Olaf's ranks wavered and grew thinner. Then, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
desperate courage, the king broke forth from the
shield-burgh that surrounded him, and followed by a
small band of devoted men, dashed against the front
of the peasant host. One by one his men fell about
him, and again and again his standard-bearer was cut
down. Severely wounded, he stood leaning against
a boulder, when Thore Hund sprang forward and
plunged his spear into his abdomen. In the next
moment Kalf Arnesson gave him a cut across the
throat, which was the immediate cause of his death,
though Thore Hund's spear had already dealt him a
mortal wound. Then, so runs the record, the sun
grew blood-red, and a strange red sheen spread over
the landscape. Darkness fell upon the fighting
hosts, and the sun grew black. A great terror took
possession of the peasants, who saw in the eclipse<a name="FNanchor_A_49" id="FNanchor_A_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_49" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
an evidence of the wrath of Olaf's God.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_49" id="Footnote_A_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_49"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> This eclipse&mdash;lasting from 1 o'clock 31' P.M. to 4 o'clock 58', Aug.
31, 1030&mdash;fixes definitely the date of the battle. It was total in
Vaerdalen.</p></div>

<p>With the king's death the battle was virtually at
an end. The peasants remained in possession of the
field. Wounded warriors of both parties crawled
about among the trees and stones, and some reached
a hut where a woman surgeon was busy washing and
bandaging their wounds. Hither came also Thormod
Kolbruna-Scald, whose left side had been pierced
by an arrow. He sat down on a bench, and a man
of the peasant army who stood by said to him:
"Why art thou so pale? Art thou badly wounded?"
He answered in verse that he had got his wound
from Danish weapons&mdash;a mocking allusion to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
alliance of the peasants with the Danish king. The
woman, not knowing how serious his hurt was, asked
him to go out and get an armful of firewood. When
he returned he looked white as a ghost. She begged
to see his wound, and with a pair of tongs attempted
to pull out the arrow, the shaft of which was broken
off. But her attempts were futile. Then the scald
took from his arm the heavy gold ring which the
king had given him for his song and handed it to
her.</p>

</div>

<p>"It came from a good man," he said; "King
Olaf gave it to me this morning."</p>

<p>Taking the tongs, he clenched them over the
stump of the arrow and pulled it out. Pieces of
flesh and red and white fibres adhered to the barbs.
He looked at them for a moment and said: "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
king has fed us well, for I am yet fat about the
heart-roots"; then fell back and died.</p>

<p>The king's body was found by a peasant named
Thorgils, who before the battle had promised Olaf
to bury him if he fell. As later tradition reports,
many miracles were wrought by the king's blood and
by the mere touch of his lifeless hand. Tales without
number were told of his marvellous powers in
life as well as in death, and legends attributing to
him the work of the Thundering Thor, have clustered
luxuriantly about his name. He slew the
trolds whom his church-bells annoyed, and turned
them to stone. St. Olaf, with the flame-red beard,
became not only the national saint, but also the national
hero. The tragic circumstances of his death,
no less than his valiant work for the cause of Christ,
imbedded his memory deeply in the people's hearts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>SWEYN ALFIFASSON (1030-1035).</h3>


<p>King Knut could not, with his extensive possessions,
devote much time to the government of Norway.
He therefore had his son Sweyn proclaimed
King of Norway in his stead. Sweyn's mother, who
accompanied him to his new kingdom, was Aelgifa,
the daughter of an ealdorman in Northampton.
The Norsemen, however, called her Alfifa, and her
son Sweyn Alfifasson. This was, accordingly, what
the chiefs had gained by their rebellion&mdash;to be openly
governed by the mistress of a foreign king and a
boy who was and could be nothing but a tool in her
hands. It was a humiliation which they could ill
brook. If Alfifa had had the faintest comprehension
of the people whom she undertook to govern, she
might possibly for a time have maintained her son
upon the throne; but when she proceeded to remodel
the Norse legislation in the feudal spirit, she
struck a blow at the very men who were the main-stay
of her power. What the chiefs had desired was
local independence&mdash;the right to manage their own
affairs with as little interference as possible. They
had hoped to obtain this liberty under a king who
was too far away to trouble them. But now came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Sweyn, and with him a number of Danes who became
very important personages, and induced the
king to modify the Norse laws so as to bring them
more nearly into conformity with the laws of Denmark.
It was then enacted that no one should have
the right to leave the country without the king's
permission, and that confiscation of property should
be the punishment for transgression. Man-slaying
was likewise to be punished by confiscation. So
also an inheritance coming to an outlawed man
should go into the king's treasury. Ships, fisheries,
pasture-land, nay, even the peasant's hearthstones
were taxed, and a system of extortion was instituted
which was galling to the spirit of free men.
Even the Christmas gifts which the peasants were to
give the king, were fixed by law. The chief end of
government seemed to be to transfer money from
the people's pockets to those of the king. It was
even asserted, though there was no law to that effect,
that during Sweyn's reign the testimony of one Dane
was sufficient to invalidate that of ten Norsemen.</p>

<p>The central principle in this legislation was the
feudal idea that all land belonged to the king, and
that the possessors, as his tenants, had to pay for
the usufruct. It was the same appropriation by the
king of all allodial rights, which was encountered
for the first time during the reign of Harold the
Fairhaired.</p>

<p>Alfifa, whom the people regarded as the author of
the odious enactments, may have had her share in
them; but far less than was popularly supposed. It
was, no doubt, Knut who meant to crush the rebel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>lious
spirit of the Norse chiefs, by which he had
himself profited, and Sweyn and Alfifa were merely
his agents.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was but natural that
the chieftains began to repent of their rebellion
against King Olaf. Einar Thambarskelver, who
prided himself on his absence from the battle of Stiklestad,
was especially active in awakening regret
among the Tr&ouml;nders at his death, and indignation at
the rule of the Danes. He sent for Bishop Grimkel,
who was living as an exile in Sweden, and agreed
with him upon a plan of action. The bishop sent
for the peasant Thorgils, who revealed the spot where
he had buried the king. Permission was obtained
from King Sweyn to bring the corpse to Nidaros,
where it was placed in a splendid sarcophagus and
interred under the altar in the Church of St.
Clement (Aug. 1031). Although nearly a year had
elapsed since the first burial, it was asserted that
there was no trace of decay on the body and that
the hair and the nails had grown. Einar and the
bishop, at all events, encouraged such reports, and
they grew in number and minuteness of convincing
details. Grimkel now declared Olaf to be a saint,
and Sweyn and Alfifa, though they raised many
objections, dared no longer profess their disbelief.
The 29th of July was set apart for the commemoration
of his martyrdom. For the first time in their
history the Norsemen felt themselves as one nation,
united in their indignation against their foreign
rulers and in their regret and veneration for the
martyred king.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>If Sweyn and Alfifa were aware of the sentiment
with which they were regarded, they chose to ignore
it. They were, however, not prepared for open defiance,
and the events of 1033 must have taken them
by surprise. In that year, a young man calling
himself Tryggve, and professing to be a son of Olaf
Tryggvesson and his wife Gyda, came from England
or Ireland with a band of warriors and claimed
the throne of Norway as his inheritance. Sweyn
called upon the chiefs to aid him in punishing the
pretender, but Einar Thambarskelver, Kalf Arnesson,
and many other magnates, refused to follow him.
With those who still recognized his authority the
king sailed southward and defeated Tryggve in a
short battle in Sognesund. On his return he and
Alfifa met the Tr&ouml;nders at the <i>thing</i> and listened
to their complaints, but could give them no satisfaction.
Then Einar Thambarskelver said aloud and
in the hearing of many: "I was not a friend of
King Olaf; but the Tr&ouml;nders proved themselves to
be poor merchants when they sold their king and
got in his place a mare with her colt. The king cannot
speak, and his mother only wishes what is bad
and has the power to do it."</p>

<p>Alfifa rose to speak, but she could get no hearing.
Einar Thambarskelver taunted her openly, and so
hostile was the sentiment that she dared not take
him to task. A sense of insecurity took possession
of the king, and he and his whole household left
Tr&ouml;ndelag and took up their abode in the southern
part of the country. His authority had practically
ceased, though in name he yet remained king. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
1034, Einar Thambarskelver, Kalf Arnesson, and
several other chiefs started for Russia and invited
Magnus, King Olaf's only son, to return with them
and become king of Norway. They asked and received
his forgiveness for their hostility to his
father, and swore to be faithful to him and to shield
him from all harm. Magnus, who was then ten
years old, accompanied them back to his native land,
and was received with enthusiastic homage at Oere-<i>thing</i>,
where he was proclaimed king. Sweyn and
Alfifa made vain efforts to raise an army, but as no
one heeded their summons, were forced to flee to
Denmark. Here Sweyn died in the year 1036. As
his father, Knut, had died in 1035, his half-brother,
Harthaknut, became the heir to his claim to Norway,
and, as we shall see, soon took measures to enforce
it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>MAGNUS THE GOOD (1035-1047).</h3>


<p>MAGNUS OLAFSSON was an illegitimate child, his
mother, Alfhild, being, according to one report, an
Englishwoman of high birth; according to another,
the queen's laundress. When he was born he was
so small and feeble that it seemed as if he could not
live many hours. It was in the middle of the night
and no one dared to wake the king. His friend,
Sighvat Scald, was therefore called, and he assumed
the responsibility of naming the child Magnus, after
Carolus Magnus, the German emperor. A priest
was then found who baptized it. When the king
heard of the occurrence he was very wroth, and
chided the scald. There was no one in his family
named Magnus, and perhaps he even suspected that
Sighvat had made a mistake in selecting the Latin
surname of the emperor rather than his real name,
Karl. It was under these unpropitious circumstances
that the boy was born who became the heir to St.
Olaf's kingdom and the love which a repentant people
lavished upon his memory. He was not quite eleven
years old when he was proclaimed king at the Oere-<i>thing</i>,
but well grown and intelligent. He allowed
himself, during the first years of his reign, to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
guided by the counsel of Einar Thambarskelver and
Kalf Arnesson; but soon gained sufficient independence
of judgment to assert his own will.</p>

<p>It was but a short time after the proclamation of
Magnus as king that Harthaknut prepared to invade
Norway. Magnus, who was eager to punish the
race of Knut for their insidious plottings against
his father, also made warlike preparations, apparently
with the intention of invading Denmark. Whether
any actual fighting took place is not known. It is
not improbable that some insignificant skirmishing
may have been done; but before any decisive battle
was fought, the chieftains in both countries interfered
and persuaded the two youthful combatants to
make peace. At a meeting at the Brenn Islands, at
the mouth of the G&ouml;tha Elv, an agreement was made
in accordance with which each made the other his
heir and successor, in case he died, without issue
(1038). This might, indeed, seem to be a remote
contingency, but it actually came to pass four years
later (1042) when Harthaknut died and Magnus was,
without opposition, proclaimed king of Denmark at
the Viborg-<i>thing</i>, and received the allegiance of the
people. Thus Norway and Denmark were for the
first time united, and the descendants of Harold the
Fairhaired were recognized by the Danish branch of
Ragnar Lodbrok's race as their equals, as they
already had been recognized by the branch governing
Sweden.</p>

<p>Magnus must have been aware that it was to the
sainthood of his father that he owed this recognition,
and he lost no opportunity to show his reverence for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
his memory. He commenced the erection of a
church in Nidaros, which was to bear St. Olafs name,
and made him a new sarcophagus, adorned with gold
and silver and precious stones. It was natural
enough that he should take pleasure in the society
of those who had been nearest to his father and
stood at his side at Stiklestad. But the hostility
aroused by the battle and the events that led to it
existed, in some measure, yet; and one party began
to fan the smouldering embers of distrust in the
king's mind and incite him to vengeance against the
other. Young as Magnus was, it is scarcely to be
wondered at that he allowed himself to be influenced
by this evil counsel. In spite of the amnesty which
he had in Russia given to those who had borne arms
against St. Olaf, he began now to punish all the
leaders in the rebellion with great harshness. It was
the Tr&ouml;nders, particularly, who had to bear the brunt
of his wrath; because it was they who had made
common cause with Knut and had been foremost in
driving the sainted king into exile. Kalf Arnesson was
among the first to experience the changed temper of
King Magnus. Jealousies had early arisen between
him and Einar Thambarskelver, both of whom called
the king their foster-son and prided themselves on
possessing his confidence. Once, it is said, Kalf had
seated himself in Einar's seat next to the king,
whereupon Einar sat down upon Kalf's shoulder,
saying:</p>

<p>"It behooves an old bull to be stalled before the
calf."</p>

<p>At a party at the estate Haug, in Vaerdalen, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
king uttered to Einar a desire to visit the field where
his father had fallen.</p>

<p>"I can give you no information about that,"
answered Einar, "as I was not present. But let
Kalf ride along with you. He can give you full
particulars."</p>

<p>"Then thou shalt accompany me, Kalf," said the
king; and Kalf, though he was very reluctant, was
obliged to follow.</p>

<p>When they reached the battle-field the king dismounted
and asked to be shown the spot where his
father had received his death-wound.</p>

<p>"He lay here," said Kalf, pointing with his spear.</p>

<p>"Where didst thou stand then, Kalf?" asked
Magnus.</p>

<p>"Here where I am now standing."</p>

<p>"Then thy axe could well reach him," cried the
king, flushing violently.</p>

<p>"My axe did not reach him," Kalf replied, jumped
on his horse and rode away. He had already given
orders to have his ship in readiness, loaded with all
his movable goods. And as soon as he reached
home he put to sea and sailed for the Orkneys.
The great possessions which he left behind were
confiscated by Magnus.</p>

<p>Thore Hund escaped punishment by making a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem from which he never returned.
Haarek of Thjotta was slain with the king's
consent by a private enemy, and many others were
deprived of their cattle and otherwise molested.
The odious laws which had been given by Sweyn
Alfifasson were not repealed; and the king acted as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
if he regarded himself as the master of every one's
goods, life, and liberty. But the Norsemen were not
accustomed to endure arbitrary conduct in their
kings. A general dissatisfaction spread through the
country, and threatened to break out in open rebellion.
In Sogn the peasants were already under
arms, and in Tr&ouml;ndelag a largely attended meeting
was held at which the bitterest denunciation of the
king found utterance. Happily, however, some were
present who were yet kindly disposed to Magnus,
and these determined to let him know how the
people felt toward him. The question then arose as
to who was to undertake this hazardous mission, for
Magnus was hot-tempered and had, moreover, made
up his mind to inflict exemplary punishment upon
the rebellious Sognings. His friends determined to
let chance decide. They drew lots, and the lot fell
upon Sighvat Scald, who, in a song called the Lay
of Candor, took the king earnestly to task for his inconsiderate
harshness, warned him of the consequences,
and reminded him of his duties to the
people, who had of their own accord made him
their king. The song made a deep impression upon
Magnus, and he was from that day a changed man.
He gave up all plans of vengeance, became gentle
and forgiving, and governed the land in accordance
with the law. His kindness and charm of manner
made him now so popular that scarcely enough could
be said in his praise. The people called him Magnus
the Good.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">MAGNUS THE GOOD AND KALF ARNESSON, AT STIKLESTAD.</span>
</div>

<p>When Magnus, in 1042, had become King of Denmark,
his ambition led him as the heir of Harthaknut,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>also to assert his claim to the crown of England.
Edward the Confessor, who was called to the throne
at the death of Harthaknut, was in honor bound to
disregard such a claim; but it compelled him to
keep a fleet in readiness to repel an expected Norse
invasion. There is little doubt but that Magnus
would have made the attempt to oust him, if the
events in Denmark had not taken a turn which
obliged him to abandon, for a time, all thought of
conquest. Among the Danes who swore allegiance
to Magnus and endeavored to win his favor was
Sweyn Estridsson, the son of Earl Ulf and Estrid,
the sister of Knut the Mighty. He was both on
his father's and his mother's side descended from
the race of Ragnar Lodbrok, and was therefore
better entitled to the Danish throne than the King
of Norway. Sweyn was like his father Ulf, a
shrewd intriguer, smooth of speech, and fair of face,
but false and treacherous. He was loud in protestations
of devotion to Magnus and succeeded in gaining
his confidence. Contrary to the advice of his
friends, Magnus made him his vassal and appointed
him his earl, giving him the same fiefs that his
father had had before him. It was to be his special
duty to defend Jutland against the Wends and the
Saxons. When the ceremony of investiture took
place, Einar Thambarskelver cried out to the king:
"Too great earl, foster-son; too great earl!" to
which the king replied angrily: "You do not credit
me with any judgment or knowledge of men. I do
not know what you mean by regarding some earls as
too great, and some as nothing at all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Sweyn was scarcely out of Magnus' sight, before
he made haste to justify Einar's apprehension.
Having regained his father's fiefs and the power
which they gave him, he called the Danish chieftains
together at the <i>thing</i> in Viborg, and was proclaimed
King of Denmark. Magnus, incensed at his treachery,
started with a large fleet to punish him; but
Sweyn ran away, first to Sweden and later to the
Wendic provinces along the Baltic. No opposition
was, therefore, offered to Magnus, and after having
chastised many who had acknowledged Sweyn as
king, he started for Jomsborg, which had also
rebelled against his authority. He stormed and
destroyed the old viking nest, and killed and scattered
its occupants. In the meanwhile an enormous
army of Wends, among the chiefs of which was
Sweyn Estridsson himself, was pouring in over Sleswick
and met Magnus at Lyrskogs Heath (1043)
where, in spite of their superior numbers, they were
overwhelmingly defeated. It is told that 10,000
corpses covered the battle-field. The victory, which
was in a large measure due to King Magnus' personal
bravery, gained him a great prestige, and what
was more, stemmed the tide of Slavonic migration
in the North. If the Wends had then gained a foot-hold
in Jutland, Denmark would probably to-day
have been a Slavonic country, and the whole destiny
of the Scandinavian North would have been changed.
Magnus took up his winter-quarters in Sleswick;
but no sooner had he dismissed part of his army
than Sweyn was again in arms, and was defeated by
Magnus in two naval battles at Aaros and Helgeness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
In the spring of 1044, when Magnus was twenty
years old, he returned to Norway. His fame filled
the North; for so great things scarcely any king of
his race had achieved at so early an age. In spite of
his hot temper, he was well beloved by all his
people; for with all his vehemence, he was upright,
generous, and noble. A pleasant story is told of
him, which throws much light upon his character.</p>

<p>In Magnus' guard there was a high-born Icelander,
named Thorstein, son of Side-Hall. Like most
of his countrymen he was not amenable to discipline,
and offended the king by going to Dublin
without his permission. In return for this he was
outlawed; but, relying upon his friends and family
connections, he returned to Norway, paying no heed
to the judgment of outlawry. He brought with him
some fine stud-horses, and offered them as a gift to
Einar Thambarskelver, whose influence with the
king was known to be great. Einar declined them;
but his son Eindride, not knowing of his father's
refusal, accepted them with joy. He even invited
Thorstein to be his guest for the winter and had the
hardihood to bring him in his company to the king's
Yule-feast. He was, however, persuaded by his
father to return home with the outlaw, before the
king had seen him. On the fourth day after Christmas,
Einar, who was sitting at Magnus' side, ventured
to put in a good word for Thorstein, to which the
king answered:</p>

<p>"Let us talk of something else: for I would not
willingly anger thee."</p>

<p>Four days later, Einar again mentioned the Ice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>lander;
but the king with a perfectly friendly manner
dismissed the subject. Then Einar let five days
pass; and once more asked that the Icelander be
forgiven.</p>

<p>"We will not speak of that," said Magnus, with
some irritation; "I do not understand how thou
canst presume to protect a man who has provoked
my wrath."</p>

<p>"That was my son Eindride's doing rather than
mine," replied Einar; "but I did think that my
prayer for a single man would have some weight
with thee; when we in all things have done and will
continue to do what will promote thy honor. * * *
I, my lord, shall be in an evil plight, if you will not
accept atonement in money from my son for Thorstein,
instead of fighting with him. For I cannot
bring it over my heart to carry arms against you.
But this will I say, that I do not perceive that you
remember how I went to find you east in Russia,
became your foster-father, and have since supported
and strengthened your kingdom, thinking late and
early of how I could advance your honor. Now I
will depart from the land, and no more aid thee.
But there will be those who will say that thou wilt
not be the gainer by all this."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Einar, in anger, jumped up from his
seat, and went toward the door. But the king arose,
hurried after him, and flung his arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"Come back, my dear foster-father," he cried;
"never shall aught, whatever it be, have the power
to break our friendship. Take the man in peace, as
it may please thee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>When Magnus had been king nine years, his uncle
Harold Sigurdsson, the son of Sigurd Syr and Aasta,
came to Norway and demanded half of the kingdom.
Harold had, as we have seen, at the age of fifteen
fought at Stiklestad, and had been severely wounded.
After his recovery he betook himself to Russia,
where for some years he held a command under
Jaroslav, and went thence to Constantinople, where
he became the captain of the Varangians, the foreign
body-guard kept by the Greek emperors. He
was a man of gigantic frame, fair of face, with long
blonde hair, and an imperious glance which betrayed
the race from which he had sprung. According to
the sagas, he made a sensation in Constantinople by
his mere appearance, and his wit, strength, and reckless
bravery opened for him a brilliant career. As
the chieftain of the Varangians, he participated in
many campaigns against the Saracens in Asia and in
Sicily, and accumulated great treasures. That some
antagonism must have existed between him and the
Greek General-in-chief, Georgios Maniakes, is evident
from the anecdotes preserved in the sagas, all of
which accord to Harold the glory for all victories, and
express the contempt with which the Norsemen
regarded the most exalted personage of the Southern
nations. That Harold's importance in these
campaigns has been exaggerated by his Norse followers,
to whom the saga-men were indebted for their
accounts, is natural enough; but even allowing for
exaggerations, it is evident that he made a great
name for himself, and was powerful enough to bid
defiance, when he was so disposed, to the Greek
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>commander. He chose, however, if the saga account
is reliable, to outwit Maniakes rather than openly resist
him.</p>

</div>

<p>Harold's adventures in Sicily, where he invented ingenious
stratagems for the capture of cities; his love
adventures with Maria, a relative of the Empress Zo&euml;,
the latter's jealousy and attempt to ruin him, his imprisonment,
fight with the serpent, flight, vengeance
upon the emperor, etc., are all of the typical kind
and, therefore, more or less suspicious. Many Germanic
heroes, both Norse and German,<a name="FNanchor_A_50" id="FNanchor_A_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_50" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> had adventures
of this order, when they visited the Orient,
and there was a curious uniformity in the fates that
befell them, both in love and war. To make the
similarity complete, it was to make himself worthy
of Elizabeth or Ellisif, the daughter of Jaroslav, that
Harold set out in quest of fame and riches; and he
did not fail to claim her on his return, and bring her
back with him to the land of his fathers. He met his
nephew, King Magnus, in Denmark, as he was sailing
through the Sound along the coast of Skaane. His
ship, in which he carried his treasures, was the most
magnificent that had ever been seen in the North;
and made a sensation wherever it appeared. Magnus,
when he saw the beautiful galley, sent men
aboard to find out whence it came and to whom it
belonged. A very tall and handsome man, with
courtly manners stepped forward, and said that he
was an embassador from Harold Sigurdsson, King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Magnus' uncle, and his errand was to learn how the
king would receive his master. In response to this,
the generous Magnus sent a message that he would
receive his uncle with open arms, as he would expect
to find a strong friend and supporter in a kinsman
like him. The tall man was none other than Harold
himself. A meeting was then arranged, and the two
kinsmen were well pleased with each other. One
there was, however, who was not pleased and that was
Einar Thambarskelver. He foresaw what was coming,
and when Harold presently advanced his claim
to half the kingdom, he could scarcely restrain his
wrath. Nevertheless, the king, who was most closely
concerned in this demand, answered gently that he
would not hastily dismiss his kinsman's request,
but would be guided by the opinion of his counsellors.
Einar, as the most important, was now asked
for his advice and he arose, saying that if King Magnus
was to cede half the kingdom of Norway to
Harold, it was only fair that Harold should share his
treasures with Magnus. This proposal did not prove
agreeable to Harold; he had not, he said, braved
dangers and gathered wealth for the purpose of enriching
his nephew's men.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_50" id="Footnote_A_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_50"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The German stories of "Herzog Ernst" and "Hugditrich," and
particularly that of "King Rother," have many features in common
with the saga records of Harold Sigurdsson.</p></div>

<p>"But," rejoined Einar aptly, "thou wast far away,
Harold, when we won the land back from the race
of Knut, and no desire have we now to divide it between
the chieftains. Hitherto we have only served
one king at a time, and thus it shall continue to be,
as long as King Magnus is alive and governs. I will
do all I can to prevent thee from getting any share
in the kingdom."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The other counsellors agreed that this judgment
was sound, and declared themselves in the same
spirit. This was the beginning of the bitter enmity
between Harold Sigurdsson and Einar Thambarskelver
which led to so many unhappy events in the
near future. Harold, who in his victorious career
had been unaccustomed to rebuffs, resented keenly
his nephew's attitude toward him; and, for the purpose
of bringing him to terms, formed an alliance with
Sweyn Estridsson. With his great wealth he had no
difficulty in raising a considerable force, with which,
in Sweyn's company, he attacked Denmark, ravaging
Seeland and Funen with ruthless cruelty. But the
moment he learned that Magnus was approaching
with his fleet, he separated from his ally and returned
in haste to Norway. To justify this breach of faith,
he spread the rumor that Sweyn had tried to assassinate
him. A man did actually, in the dead of night,
row over from Sweyn's ship to that of Harold, and
steal into the latter's cabin. But Harold, pretending
to expect an attempt upon his life, had put a
log in his bed, covering it carefully with the bedclothes.
The assassin, creeping across the floor,
struck his axe into the log and made his escape.
The next morning Harold showed the log with the
axe yet sticking in it to his men, and denouncing
Sweyn's faithlessness, set sail for Norway. There
was, however, a suspicion that he had himself arranged
the whole affair.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Norway, Harold sought his old
friends and kinsmen in Ringerike, offering them great
rewards if they would recognize him as king. But,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
partly because Magnus was so generally beloved,
partly for fear of the consequences, the chieftains
held aloof from the new pretender and discouraged
his aspirations. In Guldbrandsdale he met with a
better reception, and succeeded in gathering a band
of partisans who were ready to share his fortunes.
Here he summoned the people to a <i>thing</i>, where his
cousin Thore of Steig, a youth of fifteen years, proclaimed
him king. As soon as Magnus heard of his
uncle's doings, he sailed to Viken. Here a battle
seemed imminent, as Harold and his men were coming
southward to attack the king. Magnus, however,
was reluctant to fight against his father's
brother, and, after some negotiations, it was agreed
that the two kinsmen should both be kings, govern
together, and share equally the income from taxes
and the royal estates (1046). Norway was, accordingly,
not divided into equal parts, each with a separate
king, but the royal dignity was divided between
two kings, who both exercised authority over the
entire land. It was, as the future proved, a most
disastrous precedent, which, however, Harold the
Fairhaired himself had been the first to establish.</p>

<p>In return for his nephew's concession, Harold consented
to share with him his wealth, which is said to
have been very great, thus enabling Magnus to prosecute
with the greater vigor his war with Sweyn Estridsson.
The friendship between the two kings was,
however, but of short duration. Not only their interests
were in many points conflicting, but their
characters were such as to invite antagonism. Harold's
greed of money, his extortion of the peasants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and his jealous insistence upon every right which
Magnus had of his own accord bestowed upon him,
must have aroused in the latter's mind many bitter
reflections. And still, with his innate generosity and
forbearance, Magnus refused to credit the many complaints
that reached his ears. He was so averse to
quarrelling that, where his dignity permitted, he
rather ignored an affront than resented it. It seems,
on the other hand, as if Harold foresaw that so
strained a relation could not last, and perhaps even
desired to put an end to it. To his imperious temperament
it was galling to suffer any restraint in the
exercise of power.</p>

<p>Many incidents are related of his controversies
with Magnus and his men. Thus, on one occasion,
Einar Thambarskelver, in order to convince his foster-son
of Harold's untrustworthiness, went to a <i>thing</i>,
which the latter had summoned, and witnessed the
proceedings. Einar wore a gilt helmet and was accompanied
by sixty armed men. Harold, irritated
by his presence, surpassed himself in the severity of
his demands upon the peasants, and aroused much
indignation. An old peasant named Toke, rose and
said: "I have now lived and borne the name of
peasant in the reigns of several kings, but I supposed
when we had one king who with full right had accepted
the kingdom and been proclaimed at Oere-<i>thing</i>,
according to the counsel of the chiefs and
with the consent of the people, and a man came
later demanding the name and power of a king, that
it is the former and not the latter who has the most
power over us, his <i>thegns</i>. My advice is, therefore, ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
peasants, that we await King Magnus' decision in regard
to King Harold's demands and extortions, and
that we continue in all things to accord honor to
King Magnus."</p>

<p>When the old man had finished, Einar Thambarskelver
arose and thanked him and all the peasants
for their friendly disposition toward King Magnus.
This was more than King Harold could endure. He
sprang up and cried angrily: "Loftily dost thou
wear thy helmet now, Einar, and always thou showest
thyself as my opponent. Happy will the day be
when thy helmet shall be laid low. As thou now art
a head taller than others, thou shalt then be a head
shorter."</p>

<p>Disagreements, of a more or less serious character,
between the kings themselves were of frequent occurrence,
and it was usually the prudence and self-control
of Magnus which prevented an open rupture. No
record has been preserved of the war which they
waged together against Sweyn Estridsson. It is to
be inferred that the greater number of the Danes
took the part of Magnus against Sweyn, and that no
battle of any consequence was fought. It is told
that one day while the Norse fleet was lying close
under land, a horseman, in splendid armor, came
riding out of the forest, and began to exhibit his
horsemanship, to the great admiration of the Norse
warriors. When he had thus amused them for a
while, he rode down to the edge of the water, and
shouted: "I am a traitor to King Magnus, but so is
King Harold to me; there is an immense difference
between these kings."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment King Magnus came on deck, and
recognized Sweyn. But Sweyn spurred his horse
and vanished among the trees. No attempt was
made to pursue him.</p>

<p>"Sweyn Ulfsson is a goodly man," said Magnus,
"and if he had as much people as he has courage
and intrepidity, he would win more victories."</p>

<p>It was the bitterness that rankled in Magnus'
heart against his uncle which made him lenient in
his judgment of Sweyn. And we shall see how this
sentiment presently affected his action. He had one
day gone ashore with many of his men, and was
riding in the neighborhood of the village Alsted, in
Seeland, when his horse took fright and threw him.
He was flung with his head against a stump, and was
stunned, but afterward apparently recovered. Nevertheless,
a morbid feeling took possession of him, and
a foreboding of death darkened his mind. A dream
which he had was rather the result than the cause of
his melancholy presentiment. It seemed to him that
his father, St. Olaf, came to him and gave him the
choice between two things&mdash;viz., either to follow him
now, or to live long and be the mightiest of kings,
but load upon his soul a sin which hardly, if at all,
could be forgiven.</p>

<p>"Choose thou for me, father," he seemed to answer.</p>

<p>"Then follow me now," said St. Olaf.</p>

<p>It is not hard to guess what the mortal sin was.
That the temptation to resort to violence against his
burdensome rival must have been frequently present
to Magnus' mind, is scarcely to be wondered at.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
That the temptation was resisted, is rather a matter
of wonder.</p>

<p>A few days passed, during which Magnus pondered
the dream. Then, one morning, he woke up, burning
with fever. Einar Thambarskelver, who stood
at his bedside, asked if he was ill.</p>

<p>"Not very ill, yet, dear foster-father," he answered.</p>

<p>"It would be a sorrow which we could never get
over if we were to lose thee," said Einar.</p>

<p>Magnus begged to be moved from one part of the
ship to another; but changed his mind again and
wished to be taken back to where he had first lain.
Then Einar took alarm.</p>

<p>"Say to thy friends now, my lord, that which is
nearest to thy heart," he said. "Give us good counsel;
for mayhap our converse will not be long."</p>

<p>"Dear friend," the king replied, "I fear that this
illness will soon make an end of our intercourse."</p>

<p>When the rumor spread that King Magnus was ill,
Harold came aboard his ship and inquired about his
condition.</p>

<p>"Yes, in sooth I am ill, kinsman," said the king,
"and I have one prayer to you, that you will not
show disfavor to my friends."</p>

<p>"That is only my duty for your sake," replied
Harold, "but there are some of them who seem eternally
sufficient unto themselves, and overlook me."</p>

<p>"What boots it to speak of such things now?"
said Einar; "whatever Harold may promise, he has
already determined in his mind what he will do."</p>

<p>Little was lacking that Harold got into a dispute
with the dying king about the throne of Denmark,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
which Magnus had destined for Sweyn Estridsson,
and the gold which they had shared between them
when they shared the government. After having
distributed gifts and keepsakes to his men, King
Magnus died (1047), twenty-four years old, after
having governed Norway for twelve years and a half,
and Denmark for five years. No sooner had he
closed his eyes than Harold sent men to intercept
the messengers which had been despatched to Sweyn
Estridsson to inform him of his succession to the
Danish throne.</p>

<p>The death of King Magnus was announced to the
fleet by the blowing of <i>loors</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_51" id="FNanchor_A_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_51" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and the saying was indeed
true, in his case, that he was mourned by all the
people.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_51" id="Footnote_A_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_51"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Loors are long Alpine horns, made of wood bound with birch-bark,

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>HAROLD SIGURDSSON HARD-RULER (1047-1066).</h3>


<p>As Magnus the Good left no sons behind him,
Harold Sigurdsson was the only remaining descendant
in the male line of Harold the Fairhaired, and
therefore undisputed heir to the throne. For, although
the monarchy in Norway had not from the
earliest times been strictly hereditary, the idea had
gradually gained acceptance that the land belonged
by allodial right to the male descendants of its
first conqueror. In apparent, though not in real, conflict
with this idea, was the custom of proclaiming
the king separately at the <i>thing</i> in each shire and
personally swearing him allegiance, on condition of
his promising to rule in accordance with law and ancient
usage. As we have seen, on many occasions,
the tribal aristocracy never gave so blind an adherence
to the hereditary principle as to renounce the
practice of dictating conditions and, in many instances,
deciding the choice between the various
aspirants for the crown. If it had not been for the
unhappy precedent, established by Harold the Fairhaired,
that not one but all the sons of a king,
legitimate and illegitimate, should succeed him
on the throne, this balance of power would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
prevented an arbitrary use of his authority, on the
part of the king, and thus in the end have proved
beneficial. In fact, the great principle of constitutional
liberty is involved in this conflict of interests,
and the natural opposition of an aristocracy to the
encroachments of the crown. The situation in Norway,
as well as the temperament of the people, was
favorable to the gradual and uninterrupted development
of a constitutional monarchy, such as the English,
and if the long civil wars growing out of the
claims of rival heirs to the throne had not exhausted
the land, four hundred years of political extinction
would not have preceded the resurrection of the
nation in the present century.</p>

<p>Harold Sigurdsson soon showed that he appreciated
the advantages of his position as the sole heir
both of Harold the Fairhaired and St. Olaf. For
St. Olaf's sanctity had shed new lustre upon the
royal house, and greatly strengthened its hold upon
the people. In fact, the later kings refer the source
of their authority more frequently to their heirship
of St. Olaf than to that of Harold the Fairhaired.
When the tidings of King Magnus' death had gone
abroad, his successor called a <i>thing</i> together and declared
that it was not his intention to abide by his
late nephew's decision to leave Denmark to Sweyn
Estridsson. Denmark was his by right of inheritance,
and he meant to go at once to Viborg-<i>thing</i>
and proclaim himself king of the Danes. This
declaration was not well received by the friends of
King Magnus, and Einar Thambarskelver voiced
their feelings, when he reminded Harold that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
was his first duty to take the corpse to Nidaros
and bury it with the proper honors. The fleet then
broke up, and Harold having but a small force left,
had no choice but to accept Einar's advice. At
Borgar-<i>thing</i>, and later at Oere-<i>thing</i>, he was, according
to ancient custom, proclaimed king, no opposition
being offered to his succession. But cheerfully the
peasants did not offer him their allegiance, for
they knew him well and expected nothing good of
him. His ideas of government he had imbibed
among the Southern races, which patiently bore tyranny,
because they lacked the sense of dignity and
the sturdy manhood of the North. He had, indeed,
a more definite political programme than any of
his predecessors, but it was not a programme which
was in accord with the genius of a free Germanic
people.</p>

<p>Harold's first object, and the one which he pursued
with indefatigable zeal throughout his reign, was to
break the power of the tribal aristocracy. The influence,
authority, and calm defiance of those miniature
kings were perpetually a thorn in his flesh. His tall
growth and great physical strength, no less than the
ease with which he had so far achieved all that he had
striven for, had inspired him with a supreme self-reliance
and a corresponding contempt for all forces and
interests opposed to his own. The ruthlessness with
which he carried out his purposes made him many enemies
and procured for him the surname <i>Haardraade</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_52" id="FNanchor_A_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_52" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
<i>i. e.</i>, the hard ruler, the tyrant. What enabled him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to maintain so stern a sway over a people, so jealous
of their rights, was his superior intellect. "He
was," says Snorre, "extremely intelligent, so that
all men are agreed that there has never been a more
intelligent king in the North. Moreover, he was
an excellent swordsman, strong, and skilled in the art
of war, and altogether a man who knew how to accomplish
his purposes."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_52" id="Footnote_A_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_52"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Harold is referred to in English history as Harold the Haughty.
German histories call him H. der <i>Unbeugsame</i> (H. the Inflexible).</p></div>

<p>Interesting in this connection is also his fondness
for poetry and his skill as a scald. It is told that he
sat up half the night with the blind Icelandic scald,
Stuf Katson, and would not sleep as long as Stuf
could recite to him. This little trait adds a vivid
touch to his character and brings it closer to our
sympathy and comprehension.</p>

<p>As the leader of the opposition to Harold, Einar
Thambarskelver had long been prominent. As the
son-in-law of Earl Haakon, the friend of Earl Erik
and the foster-father of King Magnus, he occupied an
exceptional position and was highly respected. His
personal qualities were also such as to increase the
esteem with which he was regarded. In natural endowments
he was fully King Harold's match, and in
imperiousness and proud self-assertion he did not
yield much to him. Moreover, he was well skilled
in the law, and when the king, as often happened,
demanded more of the peasants than was his right,
Einar rose as the people's spokesman and checked
the arbitrary exaction. It was not to be wondered
at that Harold hated him, but it is a striking tribute
to the esteem in which he was held, that the king
refrained so long from molesting him. But rashness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
was not among Harold's faults. He was fully capable
of forecasting the results of his actions. As
yet he felt that too great a risk would be involved
in an attempt to rid himself of his enemy, who lived
on a war-footing and was prepared to meet emergencies.
With a view to weakening his power,
Harold, therefore, made the Icelander Ulf Uspaksson
his liegeman, and gave him far greater fiefs in
Tr&ouml;ndelag than Einar had. Again, in order to
break the solid front of the tribal magnates in
that part of the country and divide their interests,
he married the beautiful Thora, the sister of Eystein
Orre, of the great race of the Arnmodlings.<a name="FNanchor_A_53" id="FNanchor_A_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_53" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The king was not then divorced from his first wife,
Queen Ellisif, and it has therefore been supposed,
that Thora was only his mistress. But it is not
likely that her proud kinsmen would have allowed
her to occupy such a position,<a name="FNanchor_B_54" id="FNanchor_B_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_54" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and it appears that
the title of queen was everywhere accorded her.
It is therefore impossible to escape the conclusion
that Harold had, at the same time, two lawful wives.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_53" id="Footnote_A_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_53"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> To this family belonged Finn Arnesson, who fought at St. Olaf's
side at Stiklestad, and Kalf Arnesson, whom Magnus the Good exiled.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_54" id="Footnote_B_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_54"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> See Munch: "Det Norske Folks Historie," ii., p. 180.</p></div>

<p>The tendency to subordinate all other considerations
to policy, which Harold showed in his marriage,
was also visible in his efforts to establish a rival saint
to St. Olaf in the south of the country. The presence
of the sanctuary of the national saint in Tr&ouml;ndelag
had tended to increase the natural predominance
of that province over the southern districts
and to foster jealousies, which, in an imperfectly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>amalgamated nationality, are always rife. Viken,
which had formerly belonged to Denmark, had
never become intimately attached to the kingdom
and race of Harold the Fairhaired; and Harold
Sigurdsson judged rightly that a local saint of his
own family would accomplish the double purpose.
Such a saint was soon found in the person of Hallvard,
the son of Vebj&ouml;rn, and a cousin of the king.
His history was not very remarkable, nor was his
martyrdom, even with all its legendary embellishments,
sufficient to warrant canonization. But it
served the king's purpose well, and the regulation
miracles began to manifest themselves in the usual
fashion at St. Hallvard's shrine. Without submitting
the question to the Pope, "the people" then
proclaimed him a saint, and the king founded the
town of Oslo, probably to shelter the new sanctuary
(1051 or 1052). The site of the town was chosen
with excellent judgment at the end of the Folden
Fjord, where Christiania, the capital of Norway, is
now situated.</p>

<p>When we consider the restless energy and power
with which King Harold carried out his plans, both
in internal and in foreign affairs, we cannot but derive
a high idea of his ability. Whether, on the
other hand, his activity was for the welfare of his
subjects, is another question. Certainly, his long-continued
war with Denmark was disastrous, both
to himself and his people. His annual summer
amusement consisted, for some time, in surprising
the exposed ports on the Danish coast and harrying
them with savage cruelty. At last, when both sides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
grew tired of this aimless destruction, it was agreed
that Sweyn Estridsson should meet Harold at the
mouth of the G&ouml;tha Elv, and that the issue of the
battle should decide in regard to the latter's claim
to the throne of Denmark. At the time appointed,
however, Sweyn failed to make his appearance, and
Harold, after having waited for him in vain, sailed
southward with his fleet, ravaging the coast of Jutland,
burning the great city of Heidaby (Sleswick),
and carrying away a number of high-born women,
besides an enormous booty (1049). He was far
from expecting to be pursued by the Danes, and,
accordingly, allowed his ships to scatter on their
homeward way. Head-winds and foggy weather
delayed the Norsemen, and one morning when
they were laying to under the island of Les&ouml;,
they saw a sudden flash through the fog which
caused alarm. The king was called and asked
what he supposed it to be.</p>

<p>"The Danish fleet is upon us," he said; "that
which shines is the golden dragon-heads which flash
in the morning sun."</p>

<p>Resistance was not to be thought of, and flight
seemed also hopeless. But the king's presence of
mind did not desert him. He ordered the men to
the oars, but the ships, which were heavy and swollen
from having been long in the water, made little
headway, and, as the fog lifted, the Danish fleet,
counting several hundred galleys, was seen bearing
down upon them. Harold then commanded his men
to nail bright garments and other precious things to
logs and throw them overboard. The Danes, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
could not resist the temptation to stop and pick
them up, thereby lost time, and were rebuked by
Sweyn for their folly. Again the pursuit began,
and Harold was obliged to throw overboard malt,
beer, and pork, in order to lighten his ships. Nevertheless,
Sweyn was still gaining upon him, and Harold's
own dragon-ship, which was the hindmost, was
in danger of being captured. Then, in sheer desperation,
he made rafts out of barrels and boards,
put the Danish matrons and maidens upon them, and
lowered them into the sea. One after another of these
rafts was sent out at intervals, and the pursuers seeing
their wives and daughters stretching out their arms to
them, crying to be rescued, and some even struggling
in the water, could not forbear to pause and save
them. Thus Harold escaped, and Sweyn cursed his
ill-luck. Nevertheless, when he captured some laggards
among the Norse galleys, he refused to take
vengeance upon them.</p>

<p>During a later expedition to Denmark (1060)
Harold displayed again the same presence of mind,
and daring invention. He had just beaten Sweyn in
the battle of Djursaa, and felt perfectly safe in entering
the long and narrow Lim-Fjord for purposes of
plunder. But Sweyn, hearing that his antagonist
had gone into such a trap, hastily gathered what
forces he could command and laid to at Hals, where
the fjord is so narrow that a few ships could easily
engage a much superior number. Harold, perceiving
that he was caught, gave orders to sail in through
the fjord to the very end. Here a narrow isthmus
separates the fjord from the North Sea. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
enormous difficulty he now dragged his ships across
the isthmus, and sailed gaily northward while Sweyn
lay guarding the empty cage from which he had
escaped. To make, however, an end of this wasteful
and unprofitable warfare, Harold proposed to
Sweyn that they should stake their kingdoms in a
decisive battle in the G&ouml;tha Elv.</p>

<p>It is not perfectly clear whether Sweyn accepted
this challenge, though there is a probability that he
did, as Harold would scarcely otherwise have gone
to the place appointed for the battle. As on the
former occasion, however, he waited in vain for the
foe, and, dismissing the greater part of his force,
sailed with one hundred and eighty ships down
along the coast of Skaane until he came to Nis-aa,
where he was surprised by Sweyn with a fleet of
three hundred and sixty ships. A bloody battle
was fought, lasting through an entire night (1062),
and ending with the complete rout of the Danes. The
victory was in a large measure due to the Norse chieftain
Haakon Ivarsson, a man whom Harold had
treated with harshness, but who, in the king's need,
nevertheless, came to his rescue. Sweyn, too, owed
his safety to Haakon, on board whose ship he sought
refuge, and by whose aid he made his escape.</p>

<p>Great as the victory at Nis-aa was, its results, as
far as Harold was concerned, proved insignificant.
It was vain to suppose that Sweyn, as long as he had
any power of resistance, would renounce his throne;
and even if he had been willing to abide by such an
agreement, the Norsemen's many plundering expeditions
had made them so hated in Denmark that an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
army of occupation would have been needed to keep
the land under their sway. They were, however, no
less weary than the Danes of the incessant hostilities,
and much against his will, Harold was forced to make
peace at G&ouml;tha Elv in 1064. He recognized Sweyn
as king of Denmark, and promised no more to
molest him.</p>

<p>The excessive burdens which Harold had imposed
upon his people, in order to obtain the means to
carry on this war, had produced great discontent
among the peasants, and the important domestic
events which preceded the peace will now claim our
attention. During the prosecution of the war nothing
irritated the king more than the captious criticism
and opposition of the chieftains, and particularly of
their leader, Einar Thambarskelver. Einar, with his
six hundred men-at-arms, following him wherever he
went, was the personified defiance of the king's authority;
and Harold, when he once saw him land at the pier
in Nidaros, flaunting his power in his face, is said to
have exclaimed in verse: "Here I must see the
haughty Einar land with a band of <i>hus-carles</i> so
large that many an earl would have been satisfied
with less. He thinks, perhaps, himself to mount the
throne; and he will not stop until he has deprived
me of my kingdom, unless he has first to kiss the
thin lips of the axe."</p>

<p>Though this supposition may have been unfounded,
it is very sure that Einar shunned no
opportunity for manifesting his hostility to the king.
Once he broke up a meeting when Harold was
present, and with his armed retinue freed a convicted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
thief who had once been in his service. Another
time he forced the king, by threatening an attack, to
surrender a great treasure which once had been found
in the ground, although the law adjudged all
property thus acquired to the king. Einar, however,
claimed that some runes on the lid of the chest, containing
the treasure, showed it to have belonged to
his father-in-law, Earl Haakon, whose only surviving
heir was his wife Bergljot.</p>

<p>The king could scarcely be blamed for resenting
such insolence, but the means he chose to get even
with his enemy was unworthy of him. He had, by
chance, captured some Danish men who had in their
possession King Sweyn's seal. It is not improbable
that they were secret emissaries from the Danish
king, who was perhaps trying the tactics of his uncle
Knut, whose bribes had once alienated the Norse
chieftains from Olaf the Saint. It now occurred to
Harold that he might use these men to test the disposition
of the chieftains toward him and, what was
especially important, gain a just reason for destroying
those who should prove to be traitors. It was
particularly against Einar Thambarskelver that this
plot was directed. The men, purporting to come
from King Sweyn, brought forged letters full of
flattering assurances, and a large sum of money
which they offered Einar as a pledge of the king's
friendship. But he was equal to the test. "Every one
knows," he said, "that King Harold is not my
friend, while King Sweyn often speaks kindly of me,
and I would fain be his friend. But if he comes to
Norway with an army to fight King Harold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
harry his kingdom, I will make him all resistance in
my power, and I will help King Harold, with all the
force at my command, to defend his kingdom."</p>

<p>When the Danes returned with this message to
King Harold, he said:</p>

<p>"It was to be expected that he would answer like
a man of honor, though not out of love for me."</p>

<p>There were other surprises in store for the king on
this occasion. His friend and kinsman, Thore of
Steig, who had first recognized his claim to the kingdom,
accepted the bribe, and when informed that
Harold was coming to punish him, he went cheerfully
to meet him, and handed him the money, saying:
"A short while ago, there were some Danish
men at my house who brought me friendly letters
and money from King Sweyn. I accepted the
money, because I found it proper that you should
receive what foreign kings were using to steal your
country from you."</p>

<p>This was so shrewd an act that it extorted from
Harold, even if he did see through it, a reluctant
admiration.</p>

<p>A third man,&mdash;a peasant, named H&ouml;gne Langbj&ouml;rnsson&mdash;to
whom the emissaries came, made them
this answer:</p>

<p>"I did not think King Sweyn had heard of me,
who am only a common peasant, but my answer to
him is this: that if he comes to Norway with war-shield,
no peasant's son shall do him more harm
than I."</p>

<p>When this reply was reported to Harold he was
greatly pleased, and presently offered H&ouml;gne, as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
reward for his fidelity, the title of liegeman, which
was the highest dignity next to that of earl. But
H&ouml;gne was also proof against this temptation.</p>

<p>"All the friendship which you show me, my lord,"
he said, "I accept with thanks. But the title of liegeman
I will not have, for I well know how things will
go. When the liegemen came together they would
say: 'H&ouml;gne shall have the lowest seat, for he is
only of peasant race, and thus the lowest of the liegemen.'
My dignity would then not bring me honor,
but shame. Far greater honor it is to be called a
peasant and have the peasants say when they come
together, that H&ouml;gne is the foremost among them."</p>

<p>It is this sturdy sense of independence among
peasants which makes Norwegian history unlike
the history of any other country, and Norway the
fountain-head of constitutional liberty in Europe. It
was upon this rock that feudalism was wrecked in
Norway, while it sailed triumphant down the current
of history in Sweden, in Denmark, and all other
European lands.</p>

<p>King Harold could not help recognizing this proud
integrity, even when found in his enemies. He was
more kindly disposed even toward Einar Thambarskelver
after having become assured of his loyalty.
In order to put an end to all differences between
them, he invited the old man to a feast at the royal
mansion in Nidaros, gave him the seat of honor next
to himself, and entertained him in princely fashion.
The horns were industriously drained, and Einar,
who was nearly eighty years old, grew sleepy. As
ill-luck would have it, the king was just then telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of his adventures in Constantinople, and he regarded
the sleepiness of his guest as a mark of disrespect. He
directed one of his men to play a rough trick on the
sleeper, in return for which Einar, the next day, had
the man slain. The old enmity then broke out afresh;
and Harold, weary of the humiliations he had had to
suffer, determined to rid himself of his foe. Under
pretence of wishing to make peace with him, he
invited him to a meeting. Einar came with his son
Eindride and a large crowd of followers. The king,
having concealed assassins in the hall, had covered
up the smoke-hole so as to exclude the light. As
Einar entered, leaving his son at the door outside, he
expressed his astonishment at the darkness.</p>

<p>"Dark it is in the king's hall," he said.</p>

<p>The murderers immediately fell upon him and cut
him down.</p>

<p>"Sharp are the fangs of the king's hounds," he
cried.</p>

<p>Eindride, hearing his father's voice, rushed in to
defend him, but was instantly surrounded and slain.
In a few minutes the king strode out of the hall, and
ordered his men to prepare themselves for an attack;
but Einar's followers stood irresolute, and made no
sign to pursue him, as he walked down to the river
with his guard and rowed out to the fjord. The old
Bergljot, when she heard of the king's treachery,
rushed through the streets of the town, vainly calling
upon the people to avenge her husband and son.
She arrived at the king's mansion just in time to see
Harold's boat gliding down the river. "Now we miss
my kinsman Haakon Ivarsson," she cried; "for if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
stood here on the slope, Einar's slayer would not be
rowing down the river."</p>

<p>Harold acted wisely in betaking himself away after
having aroused the wrath of the Tr&ouml;nders by this
dastardly deed. He went to his kinsman by marriage,
Finn Arnesson, and persuaded him to use his
influence to quiet the people; in return for which
he promised to recall his brother Kalf, and restore to
him his property and dignities, of which King Magnus
had deprived him. Moreover, Finn had to undertake
a mission to Haakon Ivarsson, and induce
him to forego his vengeance for the slaying of his
kinsmen, and accept, as blood-wite, any favor which
it was in the king's power to bestow. Finn accomplished
both these missions with success; quieted the
Tr&ouml;nders, and reconciled Haakon, who, as the price
of peace, demanded the hand of Ragnhild, the
daughter of Magnus the Good, in marriage. Nevertheless,
the king had lost much in the estimation of
the people by murdering Einar. The slaying itself
they would readily have condoned; but the breach of
faith they regarded as a crime, unworthy of an honorable
warrior. Harold's disregard of faith and honor
brought about a general disregard of moral obligations.
Toward a treacherous king treason seemed
pardonable. One after another of his liegemen, discovering
his duplicity, turned away from him, left
their country, and went to King Sweyn in Denmark,
who received them well. The first who took this
course was Finn Arnesson; Kalf, his brother, was a
brave and able man, and King Harold seemed after
his return to be kindly disposed toward him. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
all that, during an expedition to Denmark, he sent
him ashore with a small band of men and commanded
him to attack a much superior Danish force,
promising to come to his aid, if necessary. Kalf
obeyed, and was killed with nearly all his men.
Then, at last, when there was no need of it, the king
landed and made an incursion for plunder into the
country. Later, he boasted of having caused the
death of thirteen men, and Finn was not wrong in
supposing that his brother was one of them. He
was so incensed at the king's treachery that he could
no more endure to meet him face to face. He sailed
with all his movable possessions to Denmark, where
King Sweyn made him Earl of Halland, a province
which now belongs to Sweden, and borders on the
Norwegian province Viken.</p>

<p>A similar experience with King Harold had
Haakon Ivarsson. He wooed Ragnhild, the daughter
of King Magnus, but received the reply that she
would not wed any man less than an earl. Haakon
then begged the king to make him an earl; but Harold
answered that he did not wish to have more than
one earl at the time in his kingdom. Full of wrath,
Haakon then betook himself to King Sweyn; but in
the battle of Nis-aa again joined Harold, and saved
him from defeat. His obligations toward Sweyn he
also discharged by rescuing him after the battle, and
sending him in safety to his friends. The fame which
Haakon acquired by these exploits, so far from bringing
him the favor of the king, rather excited his
hostility. Harold did, indeed, persuade Ragnhild
to marry him, and positively promised to make him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
an earl; but, after the wedding had taken place, he
put him off on one pretext or another, and when
Haakon pressed him for an answer, gave him a blank
refusal. His wife, who had expected a different result,
cried out to him joyously, as he returned:
"Welcome, my Earl." He was forced to tell her
what had occurred; and as he would not have the appearance
of having won her under false pretences, he
offered her divorce, and the right to keep all his
property. This was a generous offer, but Ragnhild
refused to accept it. Haakon, then, began secretly
to dispose of his property, in the hope of escaping
from the country without attracting the king's attention.
Harold, however, got wind of his purpose,
and started out with two hundred and forty men, in
the night, to kill him. Being warned by a friend, he
made his escape into Sweden, and thence to Denmark.
Sweyn made him Earl of Halland after Finn
Arnesson's death; and the Swedish king, Steinkil,
gave him the two large provinces, Vestg&ouml;tland and
Vermeland. Haakon was now in possession of almost
royal power, and he availed himself of his position
to do as much damage to King Harold as
possible. In the Oplands he had always been popular,
while the king was much disliked for having
deprived the peasants of certain privileges, bestowed
upon them by Olaf the Saint. Haakon, therefore,
had the audacity to levy taxes in this province, and
when the king's tax-gatherers came, they were informed
that there was no money due to him, as the
taxes had been paid to Earl Haakon. But King
Harold was not the man to pocket such insults. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
gathered an army, invaded Sweden, and defeated
Haakon and the Vestgoths; and the Oplanders he
punished with exemplary severity.</p>

<p>In the year 1066, Earl Tostig, the brother of the
English King Harold Godwineson, came to Norway
to enlist Harold Sigurdsson's aid in an attempt to
conquer England. He had been on a similar errand
in Denmark, but had there met with small success.
Sweyn Estridsson declared that he had no ambition
to imitate the deeds of his uncle, Knut the Mighty;
but would be quite content if he could keep and defend
his own kingdom. Harold Sigurdsson, who
never was averse to adventurous undertakings, lent a
more favorable ear to the earl's representations, and
in September, 1066, sailed for England with the
largest fleet which up to that time had ever left the
shores of Norway. About twenty thousand warriors
embarked, and with the contingent which he exacted
from the earls of the Orkneys, and Earl Tostig's own
contribution, the entire force must have amounted
to three hundred or three hundred and fifty ships
and thirty thousand men. His queen, Ellisif, and
his two daughters, Maria and Ingegerd, whom he
had brought with him, he left on the Orkneys, and
himself sailed down along the coast of Scotland to
Northumberland. At Fulford he was met by an
army under the Earls Markere and Eadwine, and
won a great victory, whereupon the city of York
surrendered. He encamped at Stamford Bridge,
about seven miles from York; but left about one
third of his army, under command of his son Olaf,
to guard the ships. The weather was warm, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
men, having no thought of danger, did not wear their
armors. At Stamford Bridge, however, they were
surprised by a large army, led by Harold Godwineson.
Tostig advised a speedy return to the ships;
but Harold Sigurdsson, being too proud to turn his
back to any foe, gave orders to await the attack of
the English. While the army was being arranged in
battle array, twenty English horsemen came riding
toward them, and one of them asked if Earl Tostig
was present.</p>

<p>"It is not to be denied that you will find him
here," answered Tostig.</p>

<p>"We bring thee this greeting from thy brother
Harold," said the Englishman, "that he offers thee
peace and Northumberland; nay, he is not indisposed
to grant thee one third of his kingdom, if he
can gain thy friendship on no other terms."</p>

<p>"This, in sooth, is another offer than the scorn
and strife which were offered me last autumn. * * *
Suppose, now, that I accept this proposal; what does
then my brother offer the King of Norway?"</p>

<p>"He has intimated how large a piece of England
he will grant to King Harold Sigurdsson; it is the
space of seven feet, or so much more as he is taller
than other men."</p>

<p>"If such is the case," Tostig rejoined, "then ride
back and bid King Harold commence the battle."</p>

<p>Harold Sigurdsson, who had listened to this colloquy,
asked Tostig who the spokesman of the Englishmen
was.</p>

<p>"That was my brother, Harold Godwineson himself,"
answered the earl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
"Too late did I learn that," said King Harold.</p>

<p>The English cavalry made the first onslaught, but
were repulsed. Thinking that their retreat indicated
a general flight, the Norsemen started in pursuit,
thus breaking up their battle array, which it was the
king's intention to preserve until the expected reinforcements
arrived from the ships. King Harold
fought with <i>berserkir</i> fury, rushing into the thick of
the fray and hewing savagely about him. The English
ranks broke, and every thing indicated a victory
for the Norsemen, when the king's throat was pierced
by an arrow, and he fell from his horse dying. Tostig
now assumed command, after having refused an
armistice, offered by his brother. He fought bravely
for a while, and the Norsemen, weary and wounded
though they were, shouted their battle-cry and rushed
forward once more, eager to avenge their king.
Then Tostig, too, was cut down, and the wide battle-field
was covered with the bodies of the slain. Just
then, Eystein Orre, King Harold's brother-in-law,
arrived with reinforcements, and a short and desperate
combat ensued, until he, too, fell. Under
cover of the twilight a small remnant of the great
army succeeded in reaching the ships. One man,
named Styrkaar Stallare, had got hold of a horse
and dashed furiously away over the fields, arrayed in
his shirt and a helmet. His clothes had been torn
off him in the heat of the combat. A cold wind was
blowing, and chilled him to the bone. On his way,
he met an English yeoman, dressed in a warm jerkin
of sheepskin. Styrkaar asked him how much he
would take for the garment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't sell it to thee," answered the yeoman,
"for I know thee by thy speech that thou art a
Norseman."</p>

<p>"If that's so," said Styrkaar, "what wilt thou
then do?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">THE OLD MAN OF HOY, ON THE ORKNEYS.</span>
</div>

<p>"I'll kill thee; but unhappily I have no weapon
that will avail me."</p>

<p>"Well, since thou seest that thou canst not kill
me," rejoined the Norseman, "let me try if I can't
kill thee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>And raising his sword, he struck off the yeoman's
head and made off with his jerkin.</p>

<p>For many years after this battle, heaps of human
bones lay scattered over the fields, for no one stayed
to bury the dead. The landing of William the Conqueror
(September 29th) called Harold Godwineson
to Hastings, where the fruits of the victory at Stamford
Bridge were lost.</p>

<p>Olaf Haroldsson, Harold Sigurdsson's son, steered
his course first to the Orkneys, where his half-sister
Maria, in the meanwhile, had died. There he remained
during the winter and spring, and sailed the
following summer, with Queen Ellisif and his sister
Ingegerd, to Norway. Of all the splendid fleet
with which his father had sailed away only twenty-four
ships returned.</p>

<p>King Harold was fifty-one years old when he fell.
In spite of the discontent of the chiefs, Norway took
great strides, during his reign, toward a settled internal
condition. The tribes were being welded into a
people. In every branch of the administration the
king's strong hand was felt. His wars, though in
one sense disastrous, tended, on the whole, to give
Norway a secure place among the nations. A long
controversy which he had concerning ecclesiastical
affairs with Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen ended
in his triumph, and though no formal decision was
made, the Norwegian Church ceased, for a while, to
recognize the supremacy of the see of Bremen. If
King Harold had been as noble as he was able, he
would have left a greater name behind him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>OLAF THE QUIET (KYRRE) (1066-1093) AND MAGNUS
HAROLDSSON (1066-1069).</h3>


<p>On his return to Norway, Olaf Haroldsson found
his elder brother Magnus, who had already been
acknowledged as king before his father's death, in
possession of the government. After some negotiations
it was agreed that the two brothers should
divide the kingdom between them&mdash;Magnus taking
the larger portion toward the north and west, and
Olaf contenting himself with Viken. If this division
was founded upon the equal allodial rights of the
brothers, it was obviously unfair. But Olaf, being
averse to quarrelling, accepted it, as far as we know,
without protest.</p>

<p>The campaign to England had largely exhausted the
resources of the country; and Sweyn Estridsson of
Denmark thought that the opportunity was now favorable
for avenging the wrongs which he had suffered at
the hands of King Harold. The brothers then made
levy in mass from all the country, but Sweyn succeeded
in engaging Olaf with his division of the
fleet, off the coast of Halland (1067), before Magnus
had joined him. The battle must have been indecisive;
for both sides claimed a victory. It is, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>ever,
probable that Olaf suffered the more, as he
was the first to propose peace. Magnus had, in the
meanwhile, come, and their allied fleets were, in all
probability, equal or superior to Sweyn's. At all
events, Sweyn had suddenly lost the desire to prosecute
the war; and a peace was made at Konghelle
(1068), at which assurances of friendship and good-will
were exchanged. Olaf is said to have borne his
part in the negotiations with a firmness and intrepidity
which inspired Sweyn with respect. As a
first result of the meeting, two marriages were arranged,
viz.: one between Harold Hard-ruler's widow,
Ellisif, and King Sweyn, and the other between Olaf
and Sweyn's daughter, Ingrid.</p>

<p>It is not known whether Magnus was present at
the peace of Konghelle. If he was, his ill health
must have prevented him from transacting any business;
for only Olaf's name is mentioned in connection
with the treaty. During the following year,
too, all public business devolved upon Olaf; for
Magnus lay ill in Nidaros and finally died in the
spring, 1069. He left one son, Haakon, who was
but an infant and was fostered by Thore of Steig.
No one put forth any claim to the kingdom in his
name, and Olaf thus became king of the whole
country.</p>

<p>With the exception of the little ripple of martial
excitement during the first years after his accession,
Olaf Haroldsson's reign of twenty-seven years presents
not a single warlike event. His saga is a saga
of peace&mdash;a long and honorable record of achievements
in the service of civilization. The key-note of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
his character was prudent moderation. He was religious,
but not fanatical; devout, but not bigoted.
Easy-going by temperament, yet negligent of no
duty, cheerful but not jolly, calm but not indolent,
he is indeed a unique but none the less attractive
figure among the martial descendants of Harold the
Fairhaired. He is the more remarkable because his
leading traits of character contrast so strikingly with
those of the prevailing type of man in his age. Serenity
of soul shines out of those of his utterances
which the sagas have thought it worth while to preserve.
There seems to be a conscious conviction, far
in advance of his century, in a saying like this:</p>

<p>"Why should I not be happy, since I am sitting
here with you at a feast, which is consecrated to my
kinsman St. Olaf, and I see both joy and liberty
among my subjects? In the days of my father this
people lived under much compulsion and fear. Then
most of them hid away their gold and treasures, but
now I see shine upon every one the ornaments which
he possesses. Your freedom and joy are my feast
and my delight."</p>

<p>The surname <i>Kyrre, i. e.</i>, the tranquil, the quiet
one, which the people gave him, whether originally
meant as a compliment or not, became, in the course
of time, an honorable distinction; for during the
century of strife and bloodshed which followed, all
looked upon his bloodless reign as upon a golden age
of peace.<a name="FNanchor_A_55" id="FNanchor_A_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_55" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> As a later author<a name="FNanchor_B_56" id="FNanchor_B_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_56" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> says: "He was in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>favor both with God and men; he laid great stress
upon peace and tranquillity; let every man keep
what was his own, and suppressed nothing but what
was evil. * * * There were then excellent crops
and manifold splendor, so that Norway had never
since Harold the Fairhaired been in such a prosperous
condition, as in his days. All the people
loved him warmly; for he conceded many a thing for
their convenience which Harold had insisted upon
with harshness and enforced with severity. He was
liberal with gold and silver and good ornaments;
but only tenacious of land; the reason of this was
his intelligence; for he saw that it was for the welfare
of the kingdom."</p>

Folk's Historie.</p></div>

<p>The story of Olaf the Quiet occupies but a few
pages in the sagas, while that of his father and his
son, both great warriors, fills much space. The
work of destroying lives, in which the latter were accomplished,
appealed more to the warlike historian
of the kings of Norway than the quiet activity for
the preservation of life and the amelioration of its
ills, to which Olaf devoted his energies. The little
that Snorre says about him is, indeed, all in his praise,
and very likely there was no one in those days who
thought of singing songs or otherwise preserving
other deeds than those of the sword. The scald who
has sung Olaf's praise has, therefore, dwelt chiefly
upon his participation in his father's foolhardy expedition
to England, and his battle with Sweyn
Estridsson.</p>

<p>It was natural that a man of Olaf's character
should have small sympathy with the viking spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
which was yet to a certain extent prevalent; and
though we do not know what he did to discourage
viking cruises, we hear that this form of
piracy became very much rarer during his reign.
One circumstance which must have been discouraging
to the vikings was the greatly increased risk
which they ran, on account of the consolidation and
increased power of the states which they were wont
to attack. England under William the Conqueror
was no longer a congenial stopping-place for Norse
pirates, and France, Spain, and Germany had likewise
taken measures for the protection of their
coasts, which greatly interfered with the summer
amusements of the Norse chieftains. A trip to Ireland,
to be sure, still offered some inducements in
the way of slaves and plunder; but along the Swedish
and the Russian coasts of the Baltic, the native
tribes had proved apt pupils of the vikings, and had
commenced plundering on their own account, thus
diminishing the chances of profit for the Norsemen.
That the influence of Christianity may also have
been active in weaning men from their predatory
habits we would fain believe, if the long carnival of
bloodshed which followed did not seem to prove the
contrary. The material considerations just cited,
were evidently the more powerful; though in the
case of the king, who himself set the example of
devotion to peaceful industries, there is no doubt
that his religion influenced his life by strengthening
the unwarlike side of his character. He manifested
his sincerity as a Christian, not only by his fondness
for the priests, whose vestments he often assisted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
putting on, but more particularly by his efforts to
change and suppress every thing which he believed to
be antagonistic to the spirit of the religion of Christ.
Thus he was the first king of Norway who endeavored
to put an end to serfdom. He gave the law,
that every shire in the kingdom should annually
manumit one thrall. His first object in giving this
order, however, was to get citizens for his towns, and
thereby encourage commerce and peaceful occupations.
Many of the thralls were artisans, and a
large number of those who had been enthralled as
prisoners of war were men of intelligence and enterprise.</p>

<p>Commerce had, even previous to the reign of Olaf
the Quiet, enjoyed periods of prosperity. The
vikings were often merchants as well as pirates, and
bought for money or goods what they could not take
with the sword. Merchants, on the other hand, who
were not vikings, had always to have the sword at
hand to defend their cargoes. A very sharp distinction
between the warrior caste and that of the
merchants, did not therefore exist, and we find that
great chieftains, nay even kings themselves, engaged
in commerce, and were not ashamed of the profit
they reaped by mercantile enterprise. Thus we
hear that Olaf the Saint went into partnership, for
one voyage, with the merchant Gudleik Gerdske,
and Harold Hard-ruler made the trade with the
Finns a royal monopoly which he farmed out to his
underlings. A considerable exchange of commodities
by barter took place between Norway and Denmark,
Sweden and England, and as piracy declined,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and the precious metals came into general use, a
more regular commercial intercourse. These first
effects of a more orderly social organization were
beginning to be visible during the reign of Olaf the
Quiet, and it is owing to this fact, that we hear so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
much about the promotion of commerce and the
prosperity of the towns. The city of Bj&ouml;rgvin (now
Bergen) was founded by him (1070-1075) and very
soon became a commercial centre of great importance.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">INTERIOR OF ORKHAUGEN, OLD NORSE DWELLING ON THE ORKNEYS.</span>
</div>

<p>As long as their occupation was war and industrial
pursuits were left to thralls, the Norsemen
could not be expected to have much sense for
domestic comfort. And the fact is that, before the
days of Olaf the Quiet, even the wealthiest of them
lived in a primitive way, on coarse food and with rude
surroundings. Their houses contained but one room,
with closed alcoves along the walls for beds. As
floor, served the bare earth, stamped hard and covered
with straw, and along the middle of it burned
fires which sent gusts of smoke and sparks through
the room. In the roof was a large hole for the escape
of the smoke, and also for the admission of light.
There were no ceilings; but the smoke-encrusted
rafters from which often depended fishing-tackle,
skins, and articles of clothing, stretched from wall to
wall. Near the eaves there were square holes in the
roof, closed with shutters. On both sides of the fire
were tables and benches which extended lengthwise
through the hall. In the middle of each of the two
benches which ran along the walls was a more elaborately
carved seat with tall posts, called the high-seat.
The high-seat on the north wall, facing south, belonged
to the master of the house; that on the south
wall was assigned to distinguished guests. The walls
were, in the houses of chieftains, decorated with finely
wrought weapons and hangings of colored cloth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Besides the principal dwelling (<i>sk&acirc;li</i>) there were a
number of smaller houses, such as the bath-house,
kitchen, woman's bower, servant's hall, and sometimes
a guest-house. Among the out-houses the
store-house, the barn, and the cow-stables were the
most important. It will be seen from this that the
farm of a well-to-do peasant must have had the
appearance of a small village.</p>

<p>In these arrangements Olaf made certain changes,
all tending toward increased comfort. In the first
place, he removed the fire-place from the middle of
the floor into a corner, and had a chimney built for
the escape of the smoke. It thus became possible
to have floors of stone or wood, and this innovation
immediately followed. Windows were cut in the
walls and furnished with panes of glass or translucent
membranes. Ceilings were made to enable one
to keep the room at a more even temperature; and
gradually several rooms were gathered under one
roof. The master's high-seat was removed to a
cross-bench on the western(?) wall; and in the king's
hall, it was placed upon a raised dais, reserved for the
king, the queen, and persons of distinction. While
in former times, the feasters had contented themselves
with the light from the fire, Olaf introduced
candles and tapers, and stationed as many taper-bearers
in front of the royal table as there were
persons of princely blood present. Courtiers were
appointed to wait upon the guests; and to members
of the <i>hird</i>, or court, who filled this office was
accorded a higher rank than the rest.</p>

<p>These innovations were undoubtedly a departure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
from the old democratic simplicity. A more lavish
expenditure was necessitated in connection with
the court, and we find that Olaf increased the number
of courtiers (<i>hirdmennir</i>) from 60, which had
hitherto been the legal number, to 120. A more
elaborate ceremonial was a direct consequence of
the greater luxury, and artificial distinctions in rank
were more emphasized than formerly. The king's
even good-nature and gentleness disguised to a great
extent the true meaning of all this, and prevented
people from seeing any harm in it. In fact, the
Norsemen were in those days fond of splendor, and
with all their fierce sense of independence they were
greatly attracted by glitter and show. The magnificence
of Olaf's household tended to increase
his popularity, for he did not impose greater burdens
upon the people in order to defray his increased
expenses.</p>

<p>We have heard that Olaf the Quiet was a zealous
Christian, and took a warm interest in the moral
welfare of his people. With a view to softening
their manners and preventing the bloody frays
which were then apt to disturb social intercourse,
he instituted clubs or associations, which were made
subject to rigid regulations. These clubs or guilds,
as they were called, met at first in the houses of their
members, but gradually, as they increased in prosperity,
built separate club-houses, or even churches,
in honor of their patron saints. St. Olaf was
their favorite patron, but guilds were also formed
under the protection of other saints. The clergy
had supervision over the members; and a peaceful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and conciliatory behavior was strenuously insisted
upon. Weapons were not permitted in the guild-halls;
and all disputes had to be settled, when both
parties had had time to cool off. To prevent brawls,
by placing a restraint upon the behavior of the turbulent,
women of good repute were made eligible,
and brief religious ceremonies opened the meetings.
The only objects of the gatherings were at first
social; but as the guilds grew more powerful, it was
impossible to prevent them from assuming a semi-political
character. The laws pledged the members to
mutual protection, and often to avenge each other's
death. They might have become dangerous to the
state, if the king and his principal advisers had not,
themselves, been members and thus able to control
their action.</p>

<p>The artisans' guilds, which in later medieval times
begin to gain political importance, were developed
from these social guilds, which did not, however,
from the beginning, confine themselves to people of
one trade or profession.</p>

<p>We hear very little about the tribal chieftains
during Olaf's reign, probably because many of the
most eminent of them had fallen at Stamford Bridge,
and the king's popularity made it seem inadvisable
to those who remained to oppose him. One of the
few men whose doings are recorded is Skule, the son
of Earl Tostig, whom Olaf had brought with him
from England after his father's death. Skule was in
1069 sent on a mission to William the Conqueror,
for the purpose of bringing Harold Hard-Ruler's body
back to Norway, and accomplished this to the king's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
satisfaction. He was the ancestor of King Inge
Baardsson, and the arch intriguer, Skule, who vainly
aspired for the throne.</p>

<p>Olaf the Quiet died on his estate, Haukby in
Ranrike, September 22, 1093. His body was brought
to Nidaros and interred in the Christ-Church which
he had himself built.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>MAGNUS BAREFOOT (1093-1103) AND HAAKON MAGNUSSON
(1093-1095).</h3>


<p>When the tidings of King Olaf's death had gone
abroad, the inhabitants of Viken acknowledged his
son, Magnus, as king, while the Tr&ouml;nders made haste
to proclaim his nephew, Haakon Magnusson. The
country was, accordingly, once more divided; two
thirds, including Tr&ouml;ndelag, the Oplands, and all the
northern shires, belonging to Haakon, and about
one third to Magnus. The latter was scarcely prepared
to find a rival to the throne in his cousin, who
during his father's long reign had given no evidence
that he cherished such an ambition. Only ignorance,
on his part, of Haakon's intentions can explain his
departure on an adventurous expedition to Scotland.
The restless, warlike spirit of his grandfather dwelt
in him, and he had chafed under the restraint which
his father's peaceful policy imposed upon him. Now
that he was free, he could afford to lose no more
time in dallying. He therefore started, as soon as he
had his hands free, on a wild-goose chase for glory;
helped the Scottish king, Donald Bane, in his warfare
against Eadgar the Etheling and his brother,
Malcolm's children; asserted (apparently with suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>cess)
his claim to the Scottish isles, which, during
Harold Hard-Ruler's reign, had made themselves independent;
aided the Irish King Muirkertach against
the earl, Gudr&ouml;d Meranagh; and finally returned
home in the summer of 1094 to find two thirds of his
kingdom in the hands of a rival. He sailed directly
to Nidaros with seven ships and took up his abode
in the new royal mansion, resolved to make the
Tr&ouml;nders feel the weight of his wrath. Haakon and
his foster-father, Thore of Steig, also hastened to the
city and put up at the old royal mansion. The relation
between the two parties was strained, and every
day people expected an outbreak of hostilities.
Finally Haakon opened negotiations with his cousin,
offering to divide the kingdom with him in equal
parts; but Magnus repelled his overtures, refusing
to recognize his title to any share in the government.
Suddenly, in the middle of the night (February,
1095), Magnus had great fires made around the
city, and Haakon's men, expecting an attack, seized
their arms and rushed into the streets. No attack
was, however, made, and both parties left the city
without any hostile collision. Haakon, in crossing
the Dovre Mountain on snow-shoes, was taken ill and
died.</p>

<p>One would have supposed that the Tr&ouml;nders had
now no longer any pretext for persevering in their
opposition to Magnus. But apparently they both
hated him, and feared that he would mete out severe
punishments to them for the support they had given
his cousin. Therefore they gave heed to the counsel
of Thore of Steig, who demanded their allegiance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to a pretender named Sweyn, a Dane by birth, and
not related to the royal house of Norway. The
rebels found many adherents in the Oplands, among
whom the liegeman Egil Aaslaksson. Under the
leadership of Thore and Sweyn they started out,
ravaging and plundering in Nordmore and Tr&ouml;ndelag.
They gave the peasants the choice either to
join them or have their houses burned over their
heads; and there were many who preferred the former
alternative to the latter. Magnus' liegeman and
devoted friend, Sigurd Wool-String (Ullstreng),
sent out war summons, but his force, which was
quite inadequate, was utterly defeated by the rebels.
He fled to Magnus, who instantly started in pursuit,
captured Thore of Steig and Egil, and hanged them.
Many others who had participated in the rebellion
were killed or deprived of their property; and as a
punishment to the Tr&ouml;nders, the laws of Sweyn
Alfifasson were re-enacted.</p>

<p>Magnus was now undisputed master of all Norway
and devoted himself with much energy to the
maintenance of order by meting out relentless justice
to evil-doers. To sit at home in inglorious ease,
punishing rebels and marauders, was not, however,
in accordance with his taste. He hated peace as
much as his father had loved it. Without any special
provocation he, therefore, determined to pay a second
visit to Scotland and Ireland for the purpose of
securely founding his dominion in those lands. It
appears that he was also cherishing a plan for invading
England and avenging the death of his grandfather
at Stamford Bridge. Haakon Paulsson, a son<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of Earl Paul of the Orkneys, who came to Norway,
stimulated his ambition, hoping himself in some
way to profit by it. With a fleet of 160 ships and
upward of 14,000 men the warlike king sailed in the
spring of 1098 for the Orkneys, and thence to the
Hebrides, where he harried with remorseless cruelty.
He conquered also the English islands of Man and
Anglesey, and made great efforts to colonize the
latter island. In the summer of 1099 he returned to
Norway, but managed within a year to get himself
into a promising quarrel with King Inge of Sweden,
one of whose provinces (Dalsland) he claimed on a
flimsy pretext. He won a great victory over the
Swedes at Fuxerne, and left a garrison of 360 men
in a fortress which he built on an island in Lake
Wener. But King Inge forced this garrison to
surrender, on humiliating terms, during the winter;
and Magnus, to avenge this disgrace, invaded Sweden
a second time, and was defeated not far from Trollh&auml;ttan.
He came then near losing his life, but was
saved by Agmund Skoftesson, who changed cloaks
with him, and, starting conspicuously away from the
other fugitives, drew the pursuers after him. This
kind of warfare was, of course, sheer waste of life
and treasure, and by the mediation of the Danish
king, Erik Eiegod, peace was concluded at Konghelle,
(1100). Magnus was to marry King Inge's daughter
Margaret, who was to receive the disputed province
as her dowry. The marriage, however, was without
issue, and Dalsland became, at the death of Magnus,
again a part of Sweden. Queen Margaret, because
she was the bringer of peace, was called by the
Norsemen, <i>Fridkulla, i.e.</i>, the peace-maker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not to be expected that Magnus should rest
contented with the fame he had now gained, and
turn his mind to the pursuits of peace. His sentiments
in that regard are well expressed in his saying:
"A king should rather strive for glory than for a
long life." In his anxiety to find a pretext for war
he finally, as it is told, sent a pair of his shoes to
King Muirkertach, in Ireland, with the request that
he should carry them on his shoulders, on Christmas
Day, in the presence of the Norse ambassadors, as a
sign that he recognized Magnus at his overlord. The
Irish were greatly incensed at this demand; but
Muirkertach, who knew something of Magnus' style
of warfare, declared that he would not only carry
the shoes, but that he would eat them too, rather
than receive another visit from the king of Norway.
This humility did not, however, save him from the
dreaded visitation. Magnus had determined upon
the conquest of Ireland, and forthwith sailed (1102)
westward with a large fleet. After having touched
at the Orkneys, he landed on Man, where he had his
son, Sigurd, proclaimed king and married to Muirkertach's
nine-year old daughter, Biadmuin. He fought
for a while with varying success in Ulster, nominally
in alliance with Muirkertach, though there is every
reason to believe that the latter was only watching
for a chance to destroy him. Such a chance finally
presented itself, while Magnus was waiting on the
coast of Ulster for a herd of cattle that had been
promised him. He had gone ashore with a small
part of his force in a swampy region, and was suddenly
surrounded by the Irish, who had hid in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
underbrush, and who, on account of their knowledge
of the ground, had a great advantage. Here Magnus
fell after a heroic combat, and the remnant of his
army made haste to return to Norway.</p>

<p>Magnus was but thirty years old at the time of his
death. He was a tall and well-grown man, of fine
features and a commanding appearance. His surname
Barefoot or Bareleg was given to him because,
after his return from his first Scotch campaign, he
adopted the Highland costume, wearing kilts instead
of trousers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>EYSTEIN (1103-1122), SIGURD THE CRUSADER (1103-1130),
AND OLAF MAGNUSSON (1103-1115).</h3>


<p>In accordance with established custom, the three
sons of Magnus Barefoot were proclaimed kings,
and the land was divided between them. There is,
however, a probability that this division pertained
chiefly to the royal estates, from which the kings
derived their principal revenue, but did not involve
a division of the country itself into separate kingdoms.
Eystein was at the time of his proclamation
fourteen years old, Sigurd thirteen, and Olaf three or
four. They were all illegitimate, but had been
acknowledged by their father. There was, at that
time, a great agitation throughout Europe on account
of the crusades. Kings, knights, and even children,
in their anxiety to save their souls, threw reason to
the winds, and, relying upon supernatural aid, started
with insufficient preparations on adventurous undertakings.
This grand religious enthusiasm did not
reach the North until its force was partly spent.
Some of the men who had visited Jerusalem returned
home, but apparently were but little affected
by religious phases of the war against the unbelievers.
They talked rather of the chances for worldly fame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and gain which the crusade presented, and aroused a
desire in many of their countrymen to win both
heavenly and earthly glory by an expedition to
the Holy Land. It was the general desire that
one of the princes should command the expedition,
and Sigurd, who had inherited his father's
spirit, willingly consented. In order to fit himself
out properly he needed money, and this he could
not get without the good-will of the people. He
had the wisdom to see, that the success of his enterprise
could be better advanced by concession than
by extortion, and he therefore abolished, once for
all, the oppressive laws of Sweyn Alfifasson, and
gained thereby a great popularity. Eystein assisted
his brother energetically in his equipments, and, in
the autumn of 1107, Sigurd sailed away with a fleet
of sixty large ships and ten thousand men. He
paid first a friendly visit to England, where he was
received with great distinction by King Henry I.
Thence he steered his course to Spain, where he had
many adventures, fought against the Moors, and
destroyed a pirate's nest on the island Formentera.
In Italy he was magnificently received by Robert
Guiscard's son, Duke Roger, who was proud of his
Norse descent, and greeted the king of Norway as he
would a kinsman. He even (if the saga account is
to be trusted) acknowledged Sigurd as his overlord,
and consented to receive the royal title from his
hands. Duke Roger died, however, soon after and
had no opportunity to assert his new dignity. It
was not until August, 1110, that Sigurd reached the
Holy Land. He landed at Joppa, where he was met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
by King Baldwin, who accompanied him to Jerusalem,
and showed him the holy sepulchre and all the places
that are associated with the Saviour's life and death.
The Patriarch of Jerusalem presented Sigurd with a
splint of the true cross to be preserved at St. Olaf's
shrine, on condition that the king, on his return, should
impose tithes for the support of the church. Before
starting on his homeward way, Sigurd assisted Baldwin
and Count Bertrand of Tripolis, at the sieges of
Sidon and Akron, and received his share of the booty.
He then betook himself to Constantinople, where
games were celebrated in his honor by the Emperor
Alexius, and a lavish magnificence was displayed in
his entertainment, the like of which the Norsemen
had never beheld. Sigurd forbade them, however,
to show surprise at any thing they saw, lest the
Greeks should conclude that they were barbarians,
unaccustomed to luxury. In July, 1111, the king
returned to Norway after an absence of three years
and a half. He received henceforth the surname
the Crusader (Jorsalfar).</p>

<p>The thirst for glory which animated Sigurd was in
striking contrast to the peaceful spirit which dwelt
in his brother, Eystein. Upon the former had descended
the restless ambition of Magnus Barefoot,
while the latter had inherited his grandfather Olaf
the Quiet's taste for building and calm delight in
well-doing. While Sigurd scoured sea and land in
search of fame, Eystein sat quietly at home, building
churches, encouraging trade and industry, and improving
the laws. By sheer dint of persuasion, gifts,
and appeals to their self-interest, he gained the alle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>giance
of the inhabitants of the Swedish province,
Jemteland, which in the reign of Haakon the Good
had belonged to Norway. Knowing the importance
of the fisheries, as a source of national wealth, he had
booths erected in Vaagen for the accommodation of
the fishermen, and a church and parsonage for their
spiritual welfare. At Agdeness, where many ships
were wrecked, he made an artificial harbor by the
construction of a mole. As a guide to sailors along
the dangerous coast, he put up sea-marks and primitive
light-houses, in the shape of fires which were
lighted, after dark, on certain rocks and promontories.
For the shelter of pilgrims to St. Olaf's shrine and
other travellers, he built taverns on the Dovre Mountain,
the passage of which had hitherto been perilous,
on account of the snow and the absence of roads.
Among the many churches which were erected by
him were the Church of the Apostles, and St.
Michael's in Bergen, St. Nicholas in Nidaros, and
the rich Benedictine Monastery, Munkeliv.</p>

<p>With all their devotion to war and tendency to
violence, the Norsemen could not help loving this
wise and peaceful king, whose constant care was
their welfare. That their old bellicose ideals were
being superseded by gentler and nobler ones is
indicated by their devotion for their two unwarlike
kings, Olaf the Quiet and Eystein Magnusson. Of
these two Eystein was, in point of intellect and
strength of character, the more eminent. He seems
to have pursued his policy of construction, instead of
destruction, not merely from temperamental bias, but
from clear-sighted conviction. His fondness for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
study of law and the importance he attached to legal
knowledge are, in this respect, significant. The sound
sense and moderation which distinguished his grandfather
he also possessed in a marked degree, besides
the same gentleness and charm of manner. In appearance
he was like most of his race, large and
handsome; he had blue eyes, blonde, curly hair, and
a dignified presence.</p>

<p>It was scarcely to be expected that two brothers,
so antagonistic in disposition as Sigurd and Eystein,
could avoid clashing. Sigurd felt himself as a man
of the world, who had cut a brilliant figure in foreign
lands, and he looked upon Eystein as a stay-at-home,
who could boast of no such experience. He scarcely
appreciated the fact that his brother, though he might
have put obstacles in his path, received him heartily,
on his return, and willingly shared his authority with
him. It was incomprehensible to him that a quiet
man like Eystein, who had no great deeds to boast
of, should enjoy as much consideration and respect
as himself. Above all, it was Eystein's insistence
upon legal methods, in all relations between subject
and king, which seemed to Sigurd an interference
with his authority, and, therefore, irritated him. A
serious disagreement soon arose from this source.
Once, when Sigurd was in Tr&ouml;ndelag, he insulted
the beautiful Sigrid, the wife of the liegeman, Ivar of
Fljod, after having sent the latter on a dangerous
expedition to Ireland. This Sigrid's brother, Sigurd
Ranesson, resented, and was, by way of revenge, accused
by the king of embezzlement in the Finn-trade,
which had been farmed out to him by Magnus Bare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>foot.
In his need he appealed to King Eystein,
who, when he heard the story, promised him his
assistance. Three times Sigurd Ranesson was now
summoned to court by King Sigurd, but every time
Eystein's superior knowledge of the law saved him.
The legal procedure, which is recorded in detail, is
full of interest, and shows a remarkable development
of the social organization, considering the time. In
the end, however, Eystein had not only to assume
the conduct of the case, but became a party to the
suit, in his client's place. King Sigurd was greatly
incensed, and Sigurd Ranesson, in order to avoid
bloodshed, went late in the evening on board of his
enemy's ship, fell on his knees before him, and said:
"I will not, my lord king, that you and your brother
shall be at strife on my account. * * * Rather I
surrender myself and my head to your power and
mercy, * * * for I would rather die than be the
cause of hostility between you and King Eystein."</p>

<p>The king, after having pondered long, answered:
"In sooth thou art a noble man, Sigurd, and thou
hast chosen the way which will be best for us all.
Know that * * * I had firmly resolved to-morrow
to go up to the Ilevolds with all my men,
and fight with King Eystein."</p>

<p>He now gave judgment that his antagonist should
pay fifteen marks in gold, which should be divided
between the three kings, but as Eystein and Olaf
both refused to accept their share of the money,
Sigurd, not wishing to be outdone in generosity,
likewise renounced his claim.</p>

<p>Though there was now no danger of war, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
relation between the brothers was yet far from
cordial. A fresh source of disagreement soon arose,
for which Sigurd, as usual, was to blame. The rumor
came to him that Eystein was very fond of a
maiden, named Borghild, the daughter of the powerful
peasant, Olaf of Dal; that he loved to sit at her
side and talk with her, and that his predilection for
her society had been the cause of scandalous reports.
Borghild, in order to prove her innocence, walked
on glowing plough-shares, and endured the test.
Sigurd, seeing that here was an opportunity to pay
his brother back for his protection of Sigurd Ranesson,
abducted Borghild and made her his mistress.
She became the mother of Magnus, who, for a short
time, was king after his father's death. Eystein
took this affair much to heart, but made no effort to
avenge the wrong he had suffered. That he felt
sore about it was, however, natural enough, and this
feeling burst forth on one occasion most unexpectedly;
though, to be sure, no allusion was made to the
real grievance.</p>

<p>It happened once, during the winter, that the two
kings were feasting together at one of Eystein's
estates. King Sigurd's men, reflecting the spirit of
their master, behaved arrogantly toward King Eystein's
people, and were fond of exalting the one
brother at the other's expense. Many complaints
were brought to Eystein, but he refused to take
note of them. The strained relation between the
two parties, however, spoiled the cheer of the table,
and the men sat sullen over their cups and were ill
at ease. Then Eystein, with perhaps a deeper pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>pose
than the apparent one, proposed a so-called
"man-measuring," or comparison of merits, which
was a favorite social pastime in those days. It is to
be remarked, that etiquette did not then forbid a
man to boast of his own deeds and accomplishments.
On the contrary, the custom survived from the age
of paganism to emphasize frankly one's merits, and
when occasion demanded, to hurl tremendous volleys
of vituperation against an adversary.</p>

<p>"Dost thou remember," Sigurd began, in response
to his brother's challenge, "how I threw thee in
wrestling, * * * although thou wast a year
older than I?"</p>

<p>"I remember also," Eystein replied, "that thou
wast my inferior in agility."</p>

<p>Step by step they now advanced through childhood
and youth, comparing each other's proficiency
in swimming, skating, shooting, skee-running, and in
personal appearance. Finally, Sigurd touched the
main point at issue, when he said:</p>

<p>"It has been generally acknowledged that the
campaign, which I made in foreign lands, was in
sooth worthy of a chieftain, while thou sattest at
home in thy country like thy father's daughter."</p>

<p>"* * * I think I also remember," Eystein rejoined,
"that it was I who fitted thee out from
home for that campaign, as I would have done a
daughter."</p>

<p>"But I went to the Holy Land and to Africa, but
there I saw thee not. I won eight battles. Thou
wast not in one of them. I went to the sepulchre of
Christ; there I saw thee not. I went to the River<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Jordan, by the same road that our Lord had gone,
and I swam across; but I saw thee not there. I
tied a knot for thee in the underbrush on the river-bank,
and it is yet waiting for thee to untie it. I
conquered the city of Sidon with the king of
Jerusalem, without thy aid or counsel."</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">HITTERDAL CHURCH. ILLUSTRATING OLD NORSE ECCLESIASTICAL
ARCHITECTURE.</span>
</div>

<p>Eystein listened imperturbably to this long list of
his brother's deeds, and finally answered: "I have
indeed heard, that thou didst fight some battles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
abroad, and what I have to match against such
deeds is but trifles. North in Vaagen I put up
booths for the fishermen, so that poor people may
find shelter and earn their living. I had a church
erected, appointed a priest, and gave land for the
support of the church. * * * Those who enjoy
the benefit of this will remember that Eystein was
king in Norway. * * * Across the Dovre
Mountain there was much travel. There people
lay out on the rocks and suffered hardships. I built
an inn and endowed it. The travellers, who now
reap the benefit of this, will remember King Eystein.
At Agdeness there was a dangerous coast and no
harbor, so that ships were often wrecked. There I
constructed a harbor, where there is excellent anchorage
for all ships. * * * I likewise built a church
there and put up sea-marks on the high mountains.
* * * All these things are now of service to
fishermen and merchants who carry the products of
the land from place to place, and they, while benefiting
by them, will remember me. * * * The
inhabitants of Jemteland I made subject to this
realm, not by violence, but by gentle words and
rational negotiations. * * * All these things
are perhaps of small moment, but I do not believe
that they are of less benefit to my country and
people, and will profit my soul less, than it will profit
thine to have sent Moors to the devil, and expedited
them head over heels to hell. * * * Now, as
regards the knot thou didst tie for me, then, methinks,
I might have tied such a knot for thee that
thou wouldst never have been king in Norway, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
thou returnedst from thy campaign, and didst sail
hither with but a single ship. Let, now, intelligent
men judge, what advantage thou hast over me, and
know ye, ye purse-proud braggarts, that there are
yet men in Norway, who dare hold themselves your
equals."</p>

<p>This was the end of the "man-measuring"; and
both kings were very wroth.</p>

<p>Several other incidents are recorded, which show
that Sigurd's jealousy of his brother would, at length,
have brought about a breach of the peace, if death
had not suddenly made an end of their intercourse.
Eystein died at the age of thirty-three, August 29,
1122. The youngest brother, Olaf, had died (1115)
before he reached manhood, and Sigurd was accordingly
the sole ruler in the land. He was now free
from the restraint, which Eystein's pacific disposition
had imposed upon him, and he presently availed
himself of his liberty to make a crusade into the
Swedish province Smaaland, where paganism yet
lingered (1123). He attacked the town of Kalmar,
from which incident the war has been called the
Kalmar War. Whether he succeeded in converting
the pagans is not known; nor are any other results
of the crusade recorded. After his return from this
campaign, a great calamity befell him. Once, it is
told, when he was in his bath, he called out, that
there was a fish in the bath-tub, and ran about trying
to catch it. It was the first symptom of the insanity
which darkened the remaining years of his life. He
was often sane for long periods; but, at times, he
would sit and brood with wildly rolling eyes, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
break out into paroxysms of wrath. Once, on the
day of Pentecost, when his madness came upon him,
he took a precious book,<a name="FNanchor_A_57" id="FNanchor_A_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_57" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> which he had brought with
him from Constantinople, and, gazing gloomily at
Queen Malmfrid, who was sitting at his side, said:
"How many things can change in a man's lifetime!
When I returned to my country, I owned two things
which seemed to me most precious,&mdash;this book and
the queen. Now the one seems only more worthless
than the other. The queen does not know how
hideous she is; for a goat's horn is sticking out of
her head. * * * And this book here is good for
nothing."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_57" id="Footnote_A_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_57"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> A codex written in letters of gold, containing probably a portion
of the Bible.</p></div>

<p>Then he rose, gave the queen a slap, and flung the
book into the fire. But in the same instant, a young
taper-bearer, named Ottar Birting, jumped forward,
snatched the book from the flames, and stepped fearlessly
before the king. "Different it is now, my
lord," he said, "from the time, when thou didst
sail with pomp and splendor to Norway, and all
thy friends hastened with joy to meet thee. * * *
Now the days of sorrow have come upon us; for
to this glorious feast many of thy friends have come,
but they cannot be glad because of thy sad condition.
Be now so kind, good my lord, to accept this advice.
Rejoice by thy gentleness first the queen, whom thou
hast so sorely offended, and then all thy chieftains,
thy men-at-arms, thy friends, and thy servants."</p>

<p>"How darest thou, ugly, low-born tenant's son,
give me counsel?" cried the king, springing up and
drawing his sword.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>All the guests expected, in the next moment, to
see Ottar's head roll on the floor. But Ottar stood,
gazing calmly into the king's face, and did not stir
from the spot. Then Sigurd suddenly stayed his
hand and let the sword fall gently upon his shoulder.
He rebuked his liegemen, for not having protested
against his insane acts, and thanked the youth for
his courage.</p>

<p>"Go, therefore, Ottar," he finished; "and take
thy seat among the liegemen. Thou shalt no more
wait upon any one."</p>

<p>Ottar Birting became in later years a man of great
fame and authority.</p>

<p>It may have been due to the unsoundness of his
mind that Sigurd, in the last years of his life committed
an act, which, however generous it may
seem, was scarcely politically defensible. In the
year 1129, a young Irishman named Harold Gilchrist
arrived in Norway and declared that he was
a son of Magnus Barefoot. It was known that King
Magnus had had a mistress in Ireland, and during
his last battle he is said to have recited a verse about
an Irish girl, whom he loved above all others. It is
therefore probable that Harold Gilchrist was, or at
least believed himself to be, heir to the throne of Norway.
He went to King Sigurd, who listened to his story,
and allowed him to prove the truth of his statement
by submitting to the ordeal by fire. He walked over
the red-hot ploughshares and endured the test successfully.
It was the priests who had charge of such
ordeals, and it was believed that they had the result
in their power. Harold Gilchrist, or Gille, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Norsemen called him, was now acknowledged by
the king as his brother, on condition that he should
make no claim to the government, as long as Sigurd
or his son Magnus was alive. It was, however, no
easy task for the king to secure for the long-necked,
thin-legged, and lanky Irishman the respect
which was due to a member of the royal family. In
the first place Harold's appearance was against him,
and in the second place, he stammered and could
scarcely make himself understood in Norwegian.
The king's son, Magnus, hated and ridiculed him,
and among the liegemen there were many who believed
him to be an unscrupulous adventurer. A
few years before his death, Sigurd put away Queen
Malmfrid, disregarding the warning of Bishop
Magne, and married a beautiful and high-born
woman, named Cecilia. He did not long survive
this marriage. Many of his friends urged him, for
the good of his soul, to dissolve it. But the fascination,
which Cecilia exercised over him, was so great,
that he could not bear the thought of losing her.
At last, when he was taken ill, she herself suggested
a separation.</p>

<p>"I did not know that thou, too, didst despise me
like the rest," he answered sadly. His face flushed
purple, and he turned away from her. His illness
now took a turn for the worse, and on March 26,
1130, he died, forty years old. Dissipations had
undermined his health, and his insanity had long
unfitted him for the cares of government. For
all that, there seems to be a halo about his
name, partly on account of his early fame, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
partly because of the good crops and commercial
prosperity which prevailed during his reign. He
seemed to the people a grand figure, and, in spite
of his great faults, every inch a king. What may
have contributed more than any thing else to endear
his memory to later generations was the evil
times that broke over the land at his death. He
seemed himself to have a foreboding of this, when
he said:</p>

<p>"Ye are badly off, ye Norsemen, for you have a
mad king; and yet methinks that, in a short while,
you will be willing to give the red gold to have me
as your king, rather than Harold or Magnus; for the
former is cruel; the latter is devoid of sense."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>MAGNUS THE BLIND (1130-1135) AND HAROLD GILLE
(1130-1136).</h3>


<p>When the tidings of his father's death reached
him, Magnus hastened to summon a <i>thing</i> in Oslo
and have himself proclaimed king of the whole
country. Harold, who had been waiting for this
opportunity to break his oath, did the same at
Tunsberg; only he contented himself preliminarily
with half the kingdom. Magnus naturally refused
to recognize his claim, and the people were soon
divided into two parties, one of which sided with
Magnus, while the other supported Harold.</p>

<p>In point of character they were both equally unfitted
for the leadership of a nation. Magnus was a
coarse, avaricious, and arrogant roisterer, addicted to
drink, and incapable of any noble impulse. Harold
was a weak and vacillating man, jolly, liberal, and
easy-going, in whom the Irish characteristics predominated.
He was pliable as wax in the hands of
the liegemen, to whom he left all the cares of state,
while he himself conceived of the royal dignity as a
mere privilege to live high, wear good clothes, and
enjoy certain honors in daily intercourse. The
tribal magnates, who had long been excluded from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the power which they believed to be their due, were
therefore attracted to him, while Magnus repelled
them by his haughtiness and avarice.</p>

<p>For three years the two rivals kept the peace; but
the fourth winter after their accession, Magnus began
to collect troops, and attacked Harold at Fyrileiv
(1134) in Viken, winning a great victory. He was
so elated at his success that, contrary to the advice
of the liegemen, he dismissed his army and betook
himself to Bergen, where he lived riotously, paying
no heed to Harold's movements. The latter, in the
meanwhile, had found a refuge in Denmark, and had
received the province of Halland in fief. He soon
gathered a sufficient force to invade Norway, and as
he sailed northward to Bergen, he gained many adherents
in the coast-shires. Magnus, when he heard
of his approach, lost his head completely, rejected
the counsel of his friend, Sigurd Sigurdsson, and
contented himself with scattering about the city a
kind of sharp, iron "foot-hooks," which in the end
only injured his own men, and locking the harbor
with iron chains, whereby he prevented his own escape,
when shortly afterward the town fell into his
enemy's hands. Most of his men then abandoned
him, while he himself, with his faithful friend, Ivar
Assersson, remained on his ship, until it was boarded
by Harold's men.</p>

<p>It is scarcely an excuse for Harold Gille to say,
that his friends induced him to commit the atrocity,
of which he was now guilty. He did not content
himself with putting Magnus' eyes out, but he cut
off one of his legs and subjected him to another still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
more revolting mutilation. Ivar Assersson, who strikingly
resembled King Magnus, was asked whether he
would now care to resemble him; and the brave man
answered unflinchingly that he would, whereupon he
too was blinded. The miserable Magnus was now
dressed in a monk's garb and shut up in the monastery
of Nidarholm. Bishop Reinald, who was suspected
of having the royal treasures in his keeping,
was hanged because he would not reveal their hiding-place.</p>

<p>These misdeeds did not long remain unavenged.
In the summer of 1136 came a man, named Sigurd,
to Norway, who also claimed to be a son of Magnus
Barefoot. Sigurd was a man of great intelligence,
courage, and ambition; and in those respects, at
least, a much worthier pretender than the weak,
vicious Harold Gille. He had led a very adventurous
life, played an important role in the feuds
between the Earls of the Orkneys, visited Rome
and the Holy Land, and bathed in the Jordan. The
ability of Harold Hard-Ruler and the restless and
enterprising spirit of Magnus Barefoot seemed to be
united in him. His mother, Thora Saxe's-Daughter,
is said to have kept the secret of his paternity from
him until he was grown, because Magnus Barefoot
had had a child by her sister, and a sense of shame
had therefore kept her silent. As a boy, Sigurd had
an ungovernable disposition, and in order to tame
his wildness, his foster-father had him educated and
consecrated to the church. When he finally kicked
through the traces, he was therefore called Sigurd
Slembedegn, <i>i.e.</i>, the Bad Priest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>On his return to Norway in 1136 Sigurd went to
Harold Gille, after having procured a safe-conduct,
and announced his origin. There was now a chance
for Harold to return the generosity, which Sigurd the
Crusader had shown to him when he came, as a poor
and unknown youth from Ireland, and proclaimed
himself heir to the throne of Norway. But, although
Sigurd Slembedegn could bring apparently satisfactory
proof of the truth of his assertion, Harold was
perhaps, on this account, only the more afraid of him.
His advisers among the liegemen who were now governing
without restraint, in the king's name, had cause
to fear a man like Sigurd who would make short
work of their pretensions. They therefore advised
the king to rid himself of the new aspirant to the
throne, by fair means or foul. On the pretence of
punishing him for his alleged participation in a
slaying, Harold made an attempt to capture him;
but Sigurd escaped by swimming, and returned the
king's breach of faith by killing him in the house of
his mistress, Thora Guttorm's-Daughter. He then
called the citizens of Bergen together, and, standing
upon his ship, avowed the murder and asked them to
make him their king. Contrary to his expectation,
however, a great indignation was aroused against
him, and the liegemen artfully fanned the excitement,
until it was no longer safe for him to remain
in the city. "If thou art the son of King Magnus,"
the citizens said, "then it is thy brother whom thou
hast assassinated." And they forthwith outlawed the
regicide and all his adherents. Sigurd fled in haste
northward on his ships and arrived in Nordh&ouml;rdland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Harold Gille was thirty-two years old, when he was
slain. He was one of the most unworthy kings that
ever disgraced the throne of Norway. It was a short
while before his death (1136) that the Wends, under
their prince, Ratibor, sacked and burned the flourishing
town of Konghelle, which Sigurd the Crusader
had enlarged and beautified.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>THE SONS OF HAROLD GILLE (1137-1161).</h3>


<p>Queen Ingerid, the widow of Harold Gille,
availed herself of the general indignation against
Sigurd Slembedegn, to have her own two-year-old
son, Inge, proclaimed king. She also sent a swift
ship to Nidaros, with the request to the Tr&ouml;nders
that they give their allegiance to King Harold's son,
Sigurd, who had reached the age of five. The powerful
liegemen, to whom this arrangement was highly
agreeable, made haste to secure the recognition of
the two boys throughout the land.</p>

<p>Sigurd Slembedegn's chances of becoming king
were thus very slight. But, hoping to revive the
indignation against Harold Gille and thereby mitigate
his own offence, he took the blind and maimed
Magnus, Sigurd the Crusader's son, out of the monastery,
and tried to rally his old friends and followers
about him. In this he had some success, but less
than he had expected. He therefore sailed to the
Hebrides for the purpose of increasing his force,
leaving Magnus in charge of Bj&ouml;rn Egilsson and
Gunnar of Gimse. Before Sigurd had returned,
however, Magnus had been attacked at Minne,
in the Oplands, by King Inge's guardian, Thjos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>tulf
Aalesson, and defeated in a bloody battle
(1137). Thjostulf, either to encourage his men, or
because he was afraid to trust him to anybody else,
carried the two-year-old king in his girdle during the
battle, while he himself fought with a sword and
spear, and the deadly missiles fell in showers about
him. The poor boy, who was unequal to such hardships,
soon began to show the effects of his premature
experience of war. A hump grew on his back
and one of his legs withered away. He therefore received
the surname "Crook-Back."</p>

<p>Magnus the Blind fled after the battle into Sweden,
where he persuaded the earl, Charles Sunesson, of
Vesterg&ouml;tland, to come to his assistance; but was
again overwhelmingly beaten at Krokaskogen by
Thostulf Aalesson (1137). The little king, Inge,
was again carried under his guardian's cloak, and
heard, though scarcely without fear, the clash of
arms and the fierce tumult of battle. This time
Magnus fled to Denmark and succeeded in inducing
King Erik Emune to sail to Norway with a fleet of
240 ships. The Norsemen, however, defended their
coast so well that the Danish king for a long while
did not venture to land. At last he burned the city
of Oslo, but was immediately afterward attacked by
King Inge and his liegeman, Aamunde Gyrdsson, at
Hornboresund, and all his great fleet routed. Sigurd
Slembedegn, in the meanwhile, had returned from
the Hebrides and was cruising about in the Baltic,
fighting in viking fashion with Wendic pirates, and
occasionally harrying on the coasts of Norway, and
injuring the friends of the young kings. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
soon joined by Magnus, and the two were met by
the fleet of the kings, Sigurd and Inge, at Holmengraa
(1139). The battle was fought with great
vehemence on both sides, until suddenly all the
Danes fled, and left their allies in the lurch. Hoping
to save the blind Magnus, Reidar Grjotgardsson
lifted him from the bed upon which he was lying,
and tried to carry him on board another ship. But
a spear pierced both from behind and they fell down,
dying. Magnus exclaimed as he felt the steel in his
vitals: "That comes seven years too late."</p>

<p>Sigurd Slembedegn leaped overboard and would
have escaped, if he had not been betrayed by one of
his own men. He was put to death by the liegemen
with the most horrible tortures. He was scourged
until his skin hung in tatters about him; then his
bones were crushed with stones; and at last he was
hanged. His marvellous fortitude during his agony
filled even his executioners with admiration. He
talked in a perfectly natural voice, and not a muscle
of his face betrayed what he suffered. Several times
he sank into a swoon; but when he revived, he was
calm and unmoved. Never did a man meet a more
horrible death with more heroic equanimity. Sigurd
Slembedegn had the stuff in him for a great king,
and if Sigurd the Crusader had sat upon the throne,
when he advanced his claim, instead of the Irishman,
Harold Gilchrist, the history of Norway would have
taken a different turn, and his might have been one
of the great names in its pages. It was true what
many, both friends and foes, said after his death,
that "there was no man more capable in all things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
than Sigurd * * * but he was born under an
unlucky star."</p>

<p>The country now had peace for some years; chiefly
because the kings were too small to have serious
quarrels. In 1142, however, came Eystein, a third
son of Harold Gille, from Scotland, and claimed his
share of the kingdom. He was considerably older
than the others, and must have been often mentioned
by his father during his lifetime; for no
one thought of disputing his claim, nor was any
proof required as to his origin. He was a dark-haired,
corpulent, and somewhat indolent youth,
avaricious in the extreme, and devoid of all personal
attractions. Some time elapsed before he
exerted any influence upon the affairs of the country,
and we shall therefore leave him, until his quarrels
with his brothers demand our attention.</p>

<p>The first cause of discord in the royal family was
the marriage of the queen dowager, Ingerid, to
the above-mentioned liegeman, Ottar Birting.
King Inge thereby came under the guardianship
of his step-father, whereby the jealousy of
other liegemen was aroused. Especially was King
Sigurd indignant, because Ottar had hitherto been
one of his most powerful adherents; while now he
became attached to the fortunes of Inge. Amid
this agitation, Ottar Birting was suddenly assassinated,
and it became clear to every one that King
Sigurd had caused his death. Many other circumstances
conspired to make Sigurd unpopular, and
his personal qualities were, indeed, such as to repel
all who came in contact with him. It was particularly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>his immorality which alienated his friends.
When he was but fifteen years old, he had a son,
named Haakon, whose mother was a pretty servant-girl.
Many pretenders appeared later, who
claimed him as their father. In appearance he
was more of a Norseman than his brothers&mdash;light-haired,
blue-eyed, tall of stature, and of great vigor.
His beauty was, however, marred by a pair of ugly
thick lips, from which he derived the surname
Mouth (Mund).</p>

<p>He hated his brother Inge, whose popularity
caused him uneasiness; and, as Eystein shared this
sentiment, he approached the latter and opened
negotiations with him, with a view to thrusting
Inge from the throne. They were soon agreed,
and would perhaps have carried out their plan, if
Inge's faithful friend, Gregorius Dagsson, who had
taken Ottar Birting's place as his guardian and adviser,
had not got wind of their purpose. When,
therefore, King Sigurd arrived in Bergen, he found
Inge prepared to receive him; and he contented
himself with killing one of his men-at-arms and
threatening "to roll the golden helmet of Gregorius
in the dust," but denied that any agreement
existed between him and Eystein to Inge's detriment.
Neither Inge nor Gregorius put any trust,
however, in his assurances; and, after many bickerings
and hostile acts on both sides, Gregorius received
Inge's permission to attack his brother. Sigurd
was then surprised in his house and slain (1155),
after having vainly begged for mercy. It is told that
the men, whose wives he had insulted, rushed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
him, eager for vengeance, and ran him through with
their swords. He was then but twenty-one years
old. Eystein, who knew that his turn would come
next, gathered in haste as many men as he could induce
to join him, in order to take vengeance on Gregorius.
But Gregorius learned of his approach in
time to escape with all his men. His family estate,
Bratsberg, was, however, burned by Eystein and his
cattle hewn down. Next, Inge's excellent dockyards,
which had been built by Eystein I., were
given over to the flames, and war seemed unavoidable
between the two kings, when Eystein, seeing
his brother's superior strength, proposed to make
peace. He agreed to pay Inge 360 marks in silver,
one third of which was to be given to Gregorius as
compensation for the destruction of Bratsberg. This
fine, however, he failed to pay; and, repenting of his
placability, sent Inge hostile messages, accusing him
of breach of faith. At last, when they had been exchanging
this kind of civilities for about a year, they
met with hostile fleets near Fors in Ranafylke (1157)
and prepared for battle. The greater part of Eystein's
force, however, abandoned him, leaving him
no choice but flight. He was captured by his
brother-in-law, Simon Skaalp, who, after having
allowed him to hear mass, coolly murdered him.
There is a legend that a spring with healing powers
burst forth on the spot where he was slain, and there
were some who believed him to have been a saint.</p>

<p>Inge was now lord of all the kingdom, although
the noble and capable Gregorius Dagsson conducted
the government and was the virtual ruler. A warm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
friendship bound the two together, based not only
upon community of interests but upon real attachment.
Inge's bad health, which unfitted him for action
in the many serious crises of his life, made him
dependent upon his sagacious and resolute adviser,
and Gregorius, who was equal to his responsibility,
kept a vigilant watch upon the king's enemies, and
at the same time exercised, with a wise moderation,
the power which had been put into his hands. It was
natural that a man occupying such a position had
many ill-wishers. There were those, of course, who
envied him the place he held in the confidence of the
king. Thus the great chieftain, Erling Skakke (the
Lop-Sided), who had married Sigurd the Crusader's
daughter, Christina, thought that he was entitled to
the first place among the liegemen of the land. Erling
traced his descent from the mighty H&ouml;rda-Kaare
(who lived in the reigns of Halfdan the Swarthy and
Harold the Fairhaired), and was thus in kinship with
Erling Skjalgsson of Sole, who played so great a
part in the times of Olaf Tryggvesson and Olaf the
Saint. He had made a crusade and fought the Saracens
in the Mediterranean, and had received a wound
in the neck, which compelled him to carry his head
on one side. His wealth and fame made him now a
conspicuous figure in the land, and it was obvious that
whichever party he should join might thereby gain a
preponderance. Erling was, indeed, himself aware
of that fact, and refrained, for this reason, for a while,
from committing himself. He was understood to be
favorably disposed to King Inge and paid him the
customary civilities, but there are indications that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Inge did not trust him. At all events, he had no intention
of buying Erling's unequivocal adherence at
the only price at which it could be bought, viz., the
dismissal of Gregorius.</p>

<p>This was the situation of affairs when, after King
Eystein's death, the remnants of his and Sigurd
Mouth's party rallied around the latter's ten-year-old
son, Haakon, and demanded for him a third part
of the kingdom. Inge answered by outlawing his
nephew and all his adherents. Gregorius was at that
time in Konghelle, occupied with defending the frontier
against the rebellious partisans of Haakon who
had found a refuge in Sweden, and Erling Skakke
availed himself of his absence to approach the king.
Although the relation between the two liegemen
was constantly growing more strained, the common
danger, to which they were exposed from Haakon's
party, made them postpone hostilities. A decisive
battle was at last fought between the latter and King
Inge at Konghelle (1159), and Haakon was defeated.
Both Erling and Gregorius were present and to their
valor the victory was largely due. A very slight
provocation was now needed to bring them into
collision, and this was supplied by a quarrel between
their men, which soon became a general
fight, and would have become a battle, if King
Inge had not personally interfered. In the meanwhile
Haakon, who had gathered under his banner
robbers, outlaws, and all sorts of adventurers, began
to ravage the frontier shires in Viken, and the presence
of Gregorius was again needed to keep him
in order. He made an attack upon the estate of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Haldor Brynjulfsson, Gregorius' brother-in-law, and
the latter's sister, Sigrid, was compelled to flee in her
night clothes from the burning house, carrying her
five-year-old son in her arms. This wanton destruction
Gregorius resolved to avenge, but during his
pursuit of Haakon's robber band, he ventured too
far out upon the insecure ice of the Bevje-Aa, fell
through, and while struggling to get ashore was
killed by an arrow (1161). King Inge wept like a
child, when he heard of his friend's death, and swore
either to avenge him or to die in the attempt.
Scarcely a month had elapsed, when he was attacked
by Haakon's band at Oslo, and fought a bloody battle
upon the ice of the Folden Fjord. Here he fell,
defending himself desperately, after having been deserted
by King Gudr&ouml;d of the Hebrides, who by his
treason decided the battle in Haakon's favor (1161).</p>

<p>Inge Crookback was the only one of Harold Gille's
sons who was an honorable man. In spite of his
physical weakness, he had courage and pluck, and a
strong sense of loyalty to those who served him well.
He was but twenty-five years old when he died.</p>

<p>It was during his reign, but while his brothers
still were alive, that the Cardinal Nicolas Breakspeare
was sent to Norway (1152) by Pope Eugene
III., to arrange the ecclesiastical affairs of the country.
He established an archiepiscopal see in Nidaros,
under the jurisdiction of which were included Norway
and all its dependencies among the Scottish
Isles, besides Iceland, Greenland, the Faeroe Isles,
and the Isle of Man. As the first archbishop he
appointed, in accordance with the wishes of King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Inge, the Bishop of Stavanger John Birgersson. The
bishopric of Hamar at Lake Mj&ouml;sen also owes its
foundation to the cardinal's visit. Nicolas Breakspeare
became, later, Pope under the name Hadrian
IV., and always preserved a lively interest in the
welfare of the Church in Norway.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>HAAKON THE BROAD-SHOULDERED, (1161-1162).</h3>


<p>Haakon Sigurdsson lost no time in proclaiming
himself king of all Norway, though he dispensed preliminarily
with the ceremony of a formal proclamation
at Oere-<i>thing</i>. As he was but a boy of fourteen,
it was, of course, his advisers who dictated his
actions. He was a tool in the hands of a few ambitious
liegemen, who had staked their fortunes on
the chance of his ascendancy. For the purpose of
portioning out lucrative offices among his adherents,
he called a secret meeting in the church of St. Hallvard
in Oslo. As it was of great importance to
Erling Skakke to know how these men felt toward
him, his wife Christina bribed the priest who kept
the keys of the church, to conceal one of her friends
where he could hear the proceedings. She then sent
a messenger to her husband, enjoining him under no
circumstances to trust Haakon or his party. But
Erling was too conspicuous a man to be allowed to
preserve neutrality; and as he could not declare
for Haakon, he was obliged to declare against him.
He then proposed, though scarcely in good faith, to
make the child, Nicholas Simonsson, the son of Simon
Skaalp and Harold Gille's daughter Maria, the head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of the opposition and to proclaim him king. There
were, however, serious objections to this course; and
after many consultations, Erling allowed himself to be
urged to do, what had been his intention from the beginning,
viz., to proclaim his own son Magnus. Magnus,
to be sure, was not of royal birth, but he had
royal blood in his veins, being the grandson of Sigurd
the Crusader. By shrewd man&#339;uvres, Erling succeeded
in rallying the greater part of King Inge's
party about his son, who was but five years old, and
to induce the liegemen to swear him allegiance. A
<i>thing</i> was then summoned to meet in Bergen, and
Magnus was formally acknowledged as king (1161).</p>

<p>The land was now divided between two tolerably
evenly balanced parties, and only the sword could
decide to which of the two the government should
belong. After the great defeat at Oslo, however,
Inge's party had lost much of its prestige, and Erling
felt that foreign help was needed to secure its predominance.
He, therefore, sailed with his son and a
large following of high-born men to Denmark and
obtained the promise of help from King Valdemar
the Great on condition of ceding to him the greater
part of Viken. Haakon availed himself of his absence
to take possession of the fleet which had
belonged to Inge and to have himself proclaimed
king at Oere-<i>thing</i>. His friend Sigurd of Reyr he
raised to the dignity of earl, and delegated to him
the task of watching for Erling, whose return from
Denmark was expected. Erling was, however, a
shrewd man who did what was least expected of
him. He did, indeed, return from Denmark, but by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
a singular route. He crossed from Skagen in Jutland
to Agder, and thence steered northward to
Bergen, where he killed or otherwise punished many
who had given their allegiance to Haakon. Then,
before Earl Sigurd had yet heard of his arrival, he
attacked Haakon in Tunsberg and beat him. Having
accomplished this and secured the recognition of
his son in Viken, Agder, Rogaland, and H&ouml;rdaland,
he returned to Bergen where he spent the winter.
Haakon, who found his strongest support in Tr&ouml;ndelag,
went into winter quarters in Nidaros.</p>

<p>It was merely a question of time when the two
rival kings, or the men who represented them, should
meet for a final contest. Therefore, as soon as the
ice broke up, preparations began on a grand scale.
Erling's cunning again stood him in good stead, for
by a stratagem he succeeded in surprising Haakon
at Sekken, in S&ouml;ndm&ouml;re, and utterly destroying him
(1162). The poor boy, who was but fifteen years
old, jumped from his ship on board the one which
lay nearest, and found himself unexpectedly among
enemies. He told the men who he was, and surrendered
himself to their mercy. The battle was then
virtually at an end; but when Erling found that the
men to whom Haakon had surrendered were determined
to guard his life, he began a fresh attack, and
managed it so that, in the tumult, the boy-king was
slain. His own former candidate for the throne,
Nicholas Simonsson, whom he had forcibly abducted
from Bergen, he also contrived to get rid of in the
same battle, and there can be little doubt that he
was responsible for his death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Haakon Sigurdsson was king of Norway for about
a year and three months. He was large for his age,
and on account of the slenderness of his waist and
the breadth of his shoulders, was called Haakon the
Broad-Shouldered (<i>Herdebred</i>).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>MAGNUS ERLINGSSON (1162-1184).</h3>


<p>Erling Skakke had effectually cleared the way
to the throne for his son, by killing every descendant
of the royal house whom he could lay hands on.
There was, however, another undoubted son of
Sigurd Mouth left, whom he had not got into his
power, besides several whose claims had not yet been
pronounced upon. The bitterness between the party
of Erling and that of Haakon was indeed so great,
that a reconciliation was not to be thought of, and
the latter, therefore, seized the opportunity to rally
about a king whose royal descent was unquestioned.
This new claimant was a boy named Sigurd Marcusfostre
(the foster-son of Marcus), probably ten or
twelve years old, who had been brought up by Marcus
of Skog, a friend and kinsman of Earl Sigurd of
Reyr. Another magnate, the much-travelled Eindride
the Young, transferred his allegiance to Sigurd,
and a large number of proud and adventurous men,
who could not tolerate Erling's supremacy, joined
the new party. The peasants, however, who had
hitherto suffered but little from the feuds of the
kings, now began to find these roving bands troublesome,
especially when they levied contributions and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
foraged wherever they went. Erling availed himself
of this circumstance to excite their indignation
against the "Sigurd party," as it was called, and he
presently succeeded in forcing the hostile chieftains
to give battle at Ree, near Tunsberg. Here Earl
Sigurd fell, and Eindride the Young, Marcus of
Skog, and the boy-king Sigurd were captured and
executed.</p>

<p>Although no formidable pretender was now left,
Erling, whose ambition was nothing less than the
founding of a new dynasty, did not feel secure in his
possession of power. The Tr&ouml;nders, who had been
partisans of Sigurd Mouth, were yet at heart devoted
to the party which represented him, and the Danish
king Valdemar was incensed, because Erling had not
kept his promise in regard to the cession of Viken.
To fortify himself against the contingencies arising
from this situation, Erling found it necessary to cast
about him for new allies, and the choice which he
made was exceedingly shrewd.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Nidaros, at that time, was the
able and imperious Eystein Erlendsson, who descended
from a mighty Tr&ouml;ndelag family, and therefore,
apart from his episcopal office, was a man of
great influence. He shared the political sympathies
of the community in which he lived, and was therefore
more disposed to be Erling's enemy than his
friend. The sagacious chieftain, however, succeeded
in propitiating him and in forming an alliance with
him for mutual advantage. The result of their negotiations
was, that a great meeting was called in Bergen,
at which Norway was declared to be St. Olaf's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
heritage and property, and the bishops, as his representatives,
acquired the right to reject any legitimate
heir to the throne, in case they held him to be unworthy.
The clerical and secular magnates were, at
the death of a king, to select among his heirs the
one who was to succeed him, the presumption being
always in favor of the eldest son born in wedlock, unless
he was declared unworthy. In case of disagreement,
a majority of votes was to decide the choice,
but only in so far as the archbishop and the other
bishops gave their consent. If the king left no
heirs of whom the magnates approved, they were at
liberty to elect any one whom they regarded as fit
to guard "the right of God and the laws of the
land."</p>

<p>It is obvious that the secular and the clerical magnates
here united for the spoliation of the crown, and
in return for the concessions which Erling had made,
as the nominal representative of the latter, the archbishop
crowned Magnus in Bergen (1164), thereby
repairing, in the eyes of many, the deficiency of his
title. He had the friendship of the Church, which had
it in her power to influence the people in his favor.
He could therefore look forward without fear to
meeting the Danish king, who was preparing to take
forcible possession of the province which had been
promised him. In order to test the sentiment of
the people toward Magnus, Valdemar sent secret
messengers with presents and friendly greetings
to many prominent Tr&ouml;nders, some of whom committed
themselves in writing to join him, in case
he invaded Norway. Their letters, however, fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
into Erling's hands, and the offenders were punished
with severity. Some were killed, others
outlawed, and again others were sentenced to pay
enormous fines. When King Valdemar finally, in
1165, sailed with a large fleet to Norway he received
a different reception from what he had expected.
The number of the disaffected who were ready to
do him homage was very small, compared to the
number of those who were ready to fight him. He,
therefore, returned to Denmark, without awaiting
Erling's arrival. It is said that he suffered from lack
of provisions; and was indisposed to harry in a province
which he hoped soon to lay under his crown.</p>

<p>Before Erling had time to return this visit, a band
of rebels was organized in the Oplands under the
leadership of Olaf Guldbrandsson, a grandson on
the mother's side of King Eystein I., the brother of
Sigurd the Crusader. This new pretender attempted
to rally the discontented chieftains under his banner.
His adherents were called the Hood-Swains (Hettesveiner),
and he himself got the surname, the Unlucky
(Ug&aelig;va), because he came within an ace of capturing
Erling at the farm, Rydj&ouml;kel, north of Lake
Oieren, but failed through mischance (1166). The
Hood-Swains then for some time eked out a precarious
existence in forest and field; for the fear of
Erling was so great that few who had any thing to
lose dared to make common cause with them. He
would probably have put an end to them without delay,
if the hostilities with Denmark had not demanded
his attention. It was, just then, the favorable moment
for attacking Valdemar's kingdom, as he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
himself absent in Wendland and his kinsman, Buris
Henriksson, who had the greater part of Jutland in
fief, had promised to co-operate with the Norsemen
and even to capture and kill the king on his return.
Erling accordingly sailed with his fleet to Denmark
and beat the Danes at Djursaa; but was prevented,
by the resolute conduct of Bishop Absalon, from
reaping any benefit from his victory. A second
campaign of Valdemar in Norway was as indecisive
as the first, and finally, when both parties were tired
of the aimless warfare, peace was concluded (1171),
on condition that Erling should govern Viken as
Valdemar's vassal and accept from him the title of
earl. It is probable that Erling, after his return,
made known only in part the terms of this peace;
for the national feeling had now begun to assert itself
in Norway; and it is scarcely credible that the people
of Viken, who had, but a short time ago, manifested
their hostility to the Danish king, should now
willingly submit to becoming his subjects. What
Erling did was really to confirm his own power and
that of his son, at the expense of the integrity and
the independence of his country. But in that respect
he only followed the traditions of his class. The
aristocracy of Norway usually (though there were
many honorable exceptions) regarded their own independence
and power as more important than those
of their country. It was not the first time that the
tribal magnates bartered away faith and honor for
personal gain. In the olden time, when Norway was
but a loose agglomeration of tribes, who felt their
kinship to the Danes and Swedes more strongly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>than they did their own geographical isolation, such
conduct was often excusable. But in the days of
Erling Skakke, the Norsemen were a nation, quite
distinct from their neighbors, and the cession of a
fertile province, like Viken, gave the Danes a foot-hold
on the peninsula, and meant in the future, as
Erling was shrewd enough to know, infinite complications,
wars, and the possible loss of independence.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">THE RAFT SUND IN VESTFJORD, BETWEEN LOFOTEN AND VESTERAALEN ISLANDS.</span>
</div>

<p>Having thus placated his foreign foes, Erling set
himself to the task of exterminating the domestic
ones. Olaf the Unlucky he had already, before the
conclusion of the negotiations, beaten in two fights
(at Stanger and at Dav, 1168), and had destroyed his
band. Olaf had fled to Denmark, where he died
(1169). There were, however, several pretenders
left who had as much right to the throne as Magnus
Erlingsson; and Erling did not choose to wait until
they became dangerous, before relieving himself of
their presence. Sigurd Mouth's daughter, Cecilia,
he sent to Vermeland and made her the mistress of
a man, named Folkvid the Lawman. His own step-son,
Harold, an illegitimate son of his wife Christina,
and accordingly a grandson of Sigurd the Crusader,
he beheaded, in spite of King Magnus' prayers and
protests. That kind of clemency which involved
future danger he professed not to understand.</p>

<p>"If I let him live," he said to his son, "they will
all want him for their king, and thee to kiss the lips
of the axe."</p>

<p>In spite of all his precautions, however, there was
one scion of the royal house, and that the most dangerous
of all, who escaped his attention. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
was, at that time, living in the Faeroe Isles a youth
named Sverre Sigurdsson, and the history of Norway
for the next thirty years is chiefly his story. But
before he enters upon the scene, a pretender named
Eystein Meyla (Little Girl), who professed to be a
son of Harold Gille's son Eystein, made a little stir
and gathered about him the remnants of the rebellious
party. He tried to obtain aid in Sweden, and
was well received by Earl Birger in G&ouml;tland, who had
married Harold Gille's daughter, Brigida. He could,
however, not sustain himself against Erling's power,
and was obliged to roam about with his band on
mountains and in wildernesses, robbing and plundering
in order to keep from starving. His men thereby
got a bad name, and on account of their dilapidated
appearance and their habit of using birch-bark for
shoes, the peasants called them derisively Birkebeiner,
<i>i. e.</i>, Birchlegs. The discipline of hardship
and danger which their arduous life imposed upon
them stood them, however, in good stead; and insignificant
though they were in number, they were,
as Erling found to his cost, not a foe to be despised.
However often he beat them, they would never stay
beaten. With wonderful intrepidity and endurance
they rallied after each defeat, and fought again, whenever
there was a chance of fighting. Many of them
were undoubtedly little better than highwaymen,
and to treat them as a political party would be an
extravagant compliment. Their chief political purpose
was, for a good while, to keep body and soul
together. Gradually, however, their band was increased
by political malcontents and even by men of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
high birth, who had quarrelled with Erling, or had
the death of kinsmen to avenge. In the summer of
1176 they were numerous enough to surprise the city
of Nidaros and have their chieftain, Eystein Meyla,
proclaimed king at the Oere-<i>thing</i>; but the following
year their luck deserted them, and in the battle of
Ree, near Tunsberg, they were overwhelmingly defeated
by King Magnus, and Eystein Meyla was slain
(1177). The band then broke up, and the Birchlegs
would perhaps never have been heard of again, if
their fortunes had not become identified with those
of a great man&mdash;Sverre Sigurdsson.</p>

<p>Sverre was born in the Faeroe Isles. His mother
Gunhild was, according to the legend, cook in the
service of King Sigurd Mouth. She was not particularly
handsome, but quick-witted and intelligent.
The king begged her to kill her child, as soon as it was
born; and being unwilling to listen to such a proposition,
she fled on a ship to the Faeroe Isles, where she
took service as milkmaid with Bishop Mathias. Here
she bore a son, whom she named Sverre. A smith or
combmaker named Unas came, the following spring,
from Norway, and she suspected him of having been
sent by the king to kill her child. She therefore hid
it in a cave, which is yet called Sverre's Cave. Unas,
however, followed her and discovered where the
child was hidden, but promised not to harm it, if
she would marry him. She consented, though reluctantly,
and returned with him to Norway. Sigurd
Mouth was then dead, and she had nothing to fear.
When the boy was five years old, he returned to the
Faeroe Isles with his mother and step-father. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
latter's brother, Roe, had been made bishop after the
death of Mathias, and Unas was not insensible to the
advantage of living in a neighborhood, where he had
such an influential relative. Sverre grew up in the
belief that he was the son of Unas, and Bishop
Roe, who took a fancy to him on account of his extraordinary
intelligence, began to educate him for
the priesthood. His ambition, as he himself asserts,
did not then extend beyond a bishopric, or possibly
a cardinal's hat. But when he was ordained as <i>diaconus</i>
(which is one of the lower grades of the priesthood),
his mother burst into tears, and to his question
why she was displeased at the honor conferred
upon him, she answered: "This is but a paltry
honor, compared to that which by right belongs to
thee. Thou art not the son of him whom thou
thinkest, but of King Sigurd in Norway. I have
kept this from thee, until thou shouldst reach the
age of manhood."</p>

<p>From that day Sverre's peace of mind was gone.
Great thoughts tossed and whirled about in his soul
and his life seemed poor and meaningless. His ambition
kept him awake in the night and bright vistas of
future achievements beckoned him from afar.</p>

<p>"If I am born to a crown," he said to his mother,
"then I will strive to win it, whatever it may cost
me. Life has no more joy for me without it, and
therefore I will stake life on it."</p>

<p>Disregarding the warnings of the bishop he embarked
for Norway, and, without revealing who he
was, spent some time in investigating the sentiments
of the people toward King Magnus. This is highly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
characteristic of Sverre. He made no leap in the
dark, but computed carefully the strength of the
enemy whom he was to combat. What he learned
was, however, far from encouraging. The people
seemed everywhere devoted to King Magnus and
well contented with his rule. Sverre also made the
acquaintance of Erling Skakke, studied him thoroughly,
and talked with his men-at-arms, who found the
priest from the Faeroe Isles a droll and entertaining
fellow, and freely told him all the gossip of the royal
household. To enter the lists, alone and penniless,
against a power so formidable as this, seemed madness.
Sverre was too shrewd not to see that such an
undertaking was hopeless. At the same time, he was
not minded to return, after his dream of royalty, to
his obscure priesthood on the bleak isles in the North
Sea. He knew that Earl Birger in Sweden was married
to a sister of Sigurd Mouth, and, as a forlorn
hope, he crossed the frontier, revealed his origin to
the earl, and begged him for aid. The earl, it appears,
who had reaped no glory from his alliance
with Eystein Meyla, did not receive Sverre's request
graciously, suspecting that he had been sent by
Erling to mock him. Sverre, then, betook himself
to his half-sister, Cecilia, who was the mistress of
Folkvid the Lawman, and met here with a better
reception. The rumor that a son of Sigurd Mouth
had made his appearance in Sweden had, in the
meanwhile, gone abroad and had reached the remnants
of the Birchleg band. They made haste to find
Sverre and requested him to be their chief; but
Sverre, seeing what condition they were in, declined.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
He made them a little speech, in which he remarked
that the only thing he had in common with them
was poverty; and advised them, in conclusion, to
select as their chief one of Earl Birger's sons, who
were, like himself, descendants of Harold Gille. The
Birchlegs acted upon this advice, but received no encouragement
from the earl.</p>

<p>He told them, perhaps not without a humorous
intention, that Sverre was their man, and advised
them, in case he persisted in his refusal, to threaten
him with death. Back they went, accordingly, to
Sverre, and this time he yielded to their persuasions.
He must then have been twenty-four or
twenty-five years old. And thus, with two empty
hands and seventy ragged and badly armed men,
he began the fight for the crown of Norway. He
started from Vermeland southward for Viken, and
so many gathered about him on the way, that by
the time he arrived in the Saurbygd, he had 420
men. These proclaimed him, in spite of his protest,
king, and touched his sword in token of allegiance.
But when he forbade them to rob and plunder
the peasants, the majority grew discontented and
left him. In order to test them he ordered them
back to Vermeland, but by the time he reached the
Eidskog, his band had shrunk to the original seventy.
Sverre was now in a serious dilemma. He
had announced himself as a claimant to the throne,
thereby making himself fair game for any one who
could slay him. And to wage war against King
Magnus and Erling Skakke with seventy men was
too absurd to be considered. In his extremity he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
sent messengers to Thelemark, where he had heard
that some Birchlegs had sought refuge after the
battle of Ree, and where there was said to be much
dissatisfaction with King Magnus. Wherever he
appeared, the peasants met him with hostile demonstrations,
and many were those who wished to earn
the gratitude of Earl Erling by destroying the runaway
priest and his robber band. But it was in these
desperate emergencies that the wonderful resources
of Sverre's mind became apparent. Though he often
had to live on bark and frozen berries, which were
dug up from under the snow, his courage never failed
him. Though in his journeys through pathless mountain
wildernesses, his men dropped dead about him
from exposure and hunger, and he had to cover himself
with his shield and allow himself to be snowed
down, he kept a stout heart in his bosom and rebuked
those who talked of suicide. It is told of
him that during his march from Sweden to Nidaros,
he came to a large mountain lake which it was necessary
to cross. Rafts were made, but the men were
so exhausted, that it took them a good while to fell
the logs. One by one the rafts were launched and
rowed across. Sverre himself boarded the last, but
it was already so heavily loaded, that the water
reached above his ankle. One man, however, who
was half dead with weariness, had been left. He
crawled down to the edge of the water and begged
the king to take him along, as otherwise he must
perish. The Birchlegs grumbled loudly, but Sverre
commanded them to lay to and take the man aboard.
The raft then sank still deeper and the king stood in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the icy water up to his knees. It looked for awhile as
if they would
go to the bottom.
But
Sverre did not
change a mien.
They reached,
at last, the further
shore,
where an enormous
pine had
fallen into
the
water. The
men, eager
for safety, scrambled
over into the
tree, and Sverre
was the last to
leave the raft,
which, the moment
his foot was
off it, sank. This
incident was regarded
by the
Birchlegs as
a miracle, and strengthened their faith in Sverre's
mission.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, after incredible hardships, Sverre arrived
early in June, 1177, at the goal of his journey. He
had then 120 men, but fortunately his message to
Thelemark brought him a reinforcement of eighty
more. With these he performed the most amazing
man&#339;uvres&mdash;dodging a force of fourteen hundred men
which the partisans of Erling had sent against him.
He anticipated with ease what his enemies would do,
while they never could form the remotest conception
of what he meant to do. Therefore the peasant army
scattered in its search for him, and was easily beaten
in separate detachments. It seems incredible that
with his 200 or 250 warriors he could have beaten
six or seven times their number, and the explanation
lies near, that many of the Tr&ouml;nders in secret sympathized
with him, though fear of Erling deterred
them from openly espousing his cause. Their success
now gave the Birchlegs courage, and they
thronged joyously out to Oere-<i>thing</i>, whither
Sverre had summoned twelve representatives from
each of the eight shires of Tr&ouml;ndelag. Here he
was proclaimed king of Norway (1177).</p>

<p>The rejoicings of the Birchlegs were however, a
little premature. Erling Skakke was, by no means,
dead yet, and he had no sooner heard of Sverre's
performances in Tr&ouml;ndelag than he gathered a large
fleet and sailed northward to have a reckoning with
him. Sverre did not care to meet the relentless
earl just then, and he therefore sought refuge again
in the mountains. For two years he led, most of
the time, a life which no dog would have envied
him; now descending into the valleys on foraging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
expeditions, now again retiring into the wilderness
and suffering untold privations. Occasionally
hunger drove him to play a practical joke on the
peasants, surprising them as an uninvited guest at
their Yule-tide feasts, sitting down with his Birchlegs
at the banqueting boards and devouring their
holiday fare. Altogether his hardships were not
unrelieved by humor. Like Robin Hood and his
Merry Men, he had pity on the small, and often dispensed
a kind of rough justice to the great. His
name was cursed from one end of the kingdom to
the other; as he himself remarked, many believed
him to be the devil incarnate. Nurses scared
naughty children with the threat that Sverre would
come and take them, and the girls when they pounded
the wet clothes at the river brink never failed to
wish that Sverre's head was under the pounder. At
the same time, a certain admiration for the power of
the man and his undauntable spirit can scarcely have
failed to affect those who had not directly suffered
by his depredations. His many battles and guerilla
fights with King Magnus and his liegemen, his second
and unsuccessful attempt to capture Nidaros, and his
skirmishing with the peasants cannot here be described
in detail, though the saga, which was prepared
under his own supervision, enables us to follow
all his movements with tolerable accuracy. It was
not until June, 1179, that he fought a battle which
gave a decisive turn to his future. Then, he made a
sudden descent from Gauldale upon Erling, who was
feasting in Nidaros.</p>

<p>"Would that it were true," said the earl, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the approach of the Birchlegs was announced to
him; "they shall then get their deserts, but for that
matter, we may sleep soundly to-night, for I have been
told that they have already retired into the mountains,
and Sverre will not venture to attack us, when
we are watching for him, as we are doing now."</p>

<p>Accordingly he told his men to go to bed; and this
they did in a condition which made it no easy task
to wake them. When Sverre, who, as usual, was
well informed, was about to make his attack, he addressed
his men as follows:</p>

<p>"Now it is necessary to fight well and bravely;
for a beautiful victory is to be won. I will tell you
what you can now obtain by your bravery. He who
can prove by truthful witnesses that he has slain a
liegeman shall himself become a liegeman; and every
man shall get the title and dignity of the man who
falls by his hand."</p>

<p>The Birchlegs needed no further encouragement.
Poorly armed though they were, they stormed down
over the hill-sides into the city. One fellow who
was rushing along with a wooden club in his hand
was asked what he had done with his weapons.</p>

<p>"They are down in the town," he answered; "as
yet, the earl's men have got them."</p>

<p>The alarm was now given, and bewildered and
heavy with sleep, the earl's warriors tumbled out
into the streets. King Magnus was also present,
but the confusion was so great that he had much
difficulty in rallying his followers.</p>

<p>Many of the chieftains advised Erling to flee on
board his ships and make his escape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't deny," he answered, "that that might
seem to be the best; but I can't endure the thought
that that devil of a priest, Sverre, should put himself
in my son's place."</p>

<p>He therefore retired outside the city to Kalvskindet
and there awaited the attack; but though his
force was far greater than Sverre's, he could not
maintain himself against the furious onslaught of
the Birchlegs. After a brief defence the earl was
slain, and the flight became general. King Magnus,
when he saw his father's bloody face upturned
against the sky, paused in his flight, stooped down
and kissed him.</p>

<p>"We shall meet again, father mine, in the day of
joy," he said, and hastened reluctantly away.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing among the Birchlegs
when it became known, that Earl Erling was dead.
Sverre, who rarely missed a chance to make a speech,
and who, moreover, was duly qualified for the office
of conducting obsequies, made a funeral oration
over his fallen foe. He drew the moral of the earl's
life, and said some things which, no doubt, were
true. But as he went on he gave more and more
play to his caustic irony, and was, perhaps, less generous
than he could have afforded to be in his judgment
of the dead chieftain.</p>

<p>From this time forth, Sverre had the upper hand,
and though the war lasted for several years more, it
changed its character. It was no longer a fight between
law and order on one side and a handful of outlawed
adventurers on the other. It was rather a civil war between
two well-matched parties. Personally Magnus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
was indeed no match for Sverre, but as the representative
of the old order of things&mdash;a monarchy deriving
its power and support from the tribal aristocracy,<a name="FNanchor_A_58" id="FNanchor_A_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_58" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;he
was no mean opponent. With Sverre and his
Birchlegs a lower stratum of society arose&mdash;an uncouth
and hungry democracy,&mdash;demanding its share
of the good things of life, which had not hitherto
been within its reach. It is Sverre's merit that he
knew how to discipline these fierce and greedy elements,
and force them into subjection to law and
order. While before the battle at Kalvskindet he
stimulated their cupidity by offering each man the
honors and dignities of the man whom he slew,
he took good care, when the victory was won, to keep
this cupidity within bounds. He kept his promises,
raised men of low degree to high offices, rewarded
fidelity and valor, and revolutionized society in a
democratic spirit. But, considering the time in
which he lived and the completeness of his victory,
he showed remarkable moderation. He meant the
new order of things which he founded to be lasting,
and instead of turning his victorious Birchlegs loose
to prey upon the state, he charged them with the
maintenance of law and order, invested them with
responsibility, and punished them if they exceeded
their authority. He could do this without peril,
because his men loved and admired him as much as
they feared him. His power over them was complete.
He had shared the evil days with them,
braved dangers and hardships, and tested their manhood.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_58" id="Footnote_A_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_58"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Munch: Det Norske Folks Historie, iii., 107. Sars: Udsigt
over den Norske Historie, ii., cap. iv.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p></div>

<p>An intimate comradeship and attachment
had grown up between them, which, however, did
not exclude authority on one side, and respect
and obedience on the other.</p>

<p>How much Magnus had lost by the battle of
Kalvskindet is indicated by the fact that his adherents
now get a party name and sink to the position
formerly occupied by their opponents. They were
called "Heklungs," because it was told of them
that they had once robbed a beggar woman whose
money was wrapped up in a cloak (<i>hekl</i>). "Birchlegs,"
from having been a term of reproach, now
became an honorable appellation which Sverre's
veterans were not a little proud of.<a name="FNanchor_A_59" id="FNanchor_A_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_59" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_59" id="Footnote_A_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_59"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Munch: iii., 106.</p></div>

<p>Magnus spent the year after his defeat mostly in
Bergen where he had many adherents, went thence
to Viken, and made every effort to gather an army
with which to destroy his enemies. He must have
had considerable success, for when he went northward
to Nidaros, he had a force much more numerous
than the one Sverre could muster. Nevertheless
he suffered an ignominious defeat at the Ilevolds
(1180), near Nidaros, and had to flee head over heels
to Bergen. Thither Sverre followed him, and came
near being caught in a trap by one of Magnus' followers,
Jon Kutiza, who came with an army of
peasants to kill that "devil's priest." The devil's
priest was, however, as usual, too clever for the
Heklungs, and sent them flying, as soon as he lifted
his sword. Magnus, in the meanwhile, had sought
refuge in Denmark, where King Valdemar received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
him well, and this kingdom became the base of operations
against Sverre. Long time did not elapse
before the Heklungs were again on the way northward
with thirty-two ships, and came within an ace
of making an end of Sverre in the Salt&ouml; Sound; but
as usual he slipped out of the trap by a daring stratagem.
Soon after, Magnus overtook the Birchlegs at
Nordness (1181), near Bergen, and this time Sverre,
who was anxious not to lose his prestige, determined
to stay and give battle, although his fleet was but
half as large as that of his enemies. The Birchlegs
were, as a rule, not good sailors, and never fought as
well on the sea as on dry land. The Heklungs made
a fierce onset, and were gradually gaining several
advantages, when Sverre stepped forward where the
fight was hottest, lifted his hands toward the sky,
and sang in a loud, clear voice the Latin hymn,
"Alma chorus domini." Hostile missiles beat like
hail about him; but though he had no shield, he remained
unharmed. Just then Magnus, flushed with
warlike zeal, stormed forward and was on the point
of boarding one of the hostile ships, when he received
a wound through the wrist. The pain made
him pause abruptly, and in so doing he slipped upon
the bloody deck and fell backward. The Birchlegs
sent up a tremendous shout of victory, and Orm
King's-Brother (a half-brother of Harold Gille's sons),
hearing that the king was slain, cried: "Then the
fate of the realm is decided."</p>

<p>Instantly he cut the ropes which held the ships together,
and, breaking the battle-line, fled as fast as he
could. Magnus, getting on his feet, called vainly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
his men that he was alive, and begged them not to
flee from a victory. But the confusion soon became
general, and Sverre, who was quick to take advantage
of it, captured ship after ship and forced the rest into
ignominious flight.</p>

<p>The war was still continued for three years with
changing fortunes. In fact, Magnus, whenever he
returned from Denmark, where he sojourned in the
intervals between his defeats, seemed as formidable
as ever, and had little difficulty in gathering an army
under his banner. Sverre, therefore, in order to put
an end to an internecine conflict which was draining
the resources of the country, proposed to share the
kingdom with him, and, when this proposal was rejected,
that they should reign alternately for a term
of three years each. This well-meant offer Magnus
likewise repelled, and, after repeated interviews and
fruitless negotiations, hostilities were resumed.
Three times during the years 1181 and 1182 the
Heklungs attacked Nidaros, where the Birchlegs had
their head-quarters, and fought with variable success.
In 1183 Sverre assumed again the offensive, surprised
Magnus in Bergen, and compelled him to flee
to Denmark, abandoning his fleet, his treasures, and
the crown regalia. Archbishop Eystein, who had
been one of the staunchest partisans of the Heklungs,
had, some years before, fled to England, and had
hoped to injure Sverre by declaring him in the ban
of the church. Sverre was, however, not in the least
disturbed by the ban, while the archbishop was
greatly disturbed by the loss of his see. Perceiving
that Magnus' chances of regaining his power were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
diminishing, the wily prelate opened negotiations with
the excommunicated king and received him back
into the bosom of the Church, on condition of being
restored to his dignities.</p>

<p>A last attempt to recover what he had lost was
made by Magnus in the summer of 1184. He then
sailed northward to Bergen with a fleet of twenty-six
ships and about three thousand two hundred men.
He learned that Sverre had sailed up into the Norefjord
(a narrow arm of the Sognefjord) with a few
ships and a small force of men, for the purpose of
punishing the Sognings, who had killed his prefect,
Ivar Darre. Sverre was, as a rule, not easily surprised.
But in the present instance he had not the
faintest suspicion of danger until he saw the galleys
of the Heklungs steering right down upon him.
Escape was not to be thought of. He was shut in
on all sides. The Heklungs, seeing that he had but
fourteen ships, and that his force scarcely numbered
more than half of theirs, were disposed to give thanks
to God for having at last delivered their enemies into
their hands. But it is sometimes a doubtful blessing
to have such enemies as the Birchlegs delivered into
one's hands. At all events, Magnus began to have
doubts, as soon as battle had commenced, as to who
were the captors and who the captives. The Birchlegs
fought with heroism, and the Heklungs fell
in great numbers and many leaped into the sea.
Among the latter was King Magnus. It was midnight
before the bloody work was at an end, and by
that time two thousand men had lost their lives.
All the ships of the Heklungs and much booty fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
into Sverre's hands. When the morning broke there
could be seen through the clear waters of the Sognefjord
the corpses of slain chieftains lying outstretched
on the bottom, while the fishes swam around them.
The corpse of King Magnus was not found until two
days after the battle, and was then taken to Bergen,
where it was buried with great solemnity.</p>

<p>In the battle of Norefjord fell, beside the king, the
flower of the Norse aristocracy. King Inge's son
Harold, Orm King's-Brother and his son Ivar Steig,
and a large number of proud chieftains, were among
the slain. They had pinned their hope to King
Magnus, and with his death their dominion was at
an end. With Sverre Sigurdsson's reign begins a
new epoch in the history of Norway.</p>

<h3>SVERRE SIGURDSSON (1182-1202).</h3>


<p>It was a dangerous precedent Sverre established
when, without any other proof of his royal birth than
his own assertion, he ascended the throne of Norway.
The prospect was thus opened to any ambitious adventurer,
skilled in mendacity and the use of arms, to
snatch the crown at the point of the sword. The
mere fact that a doubt existed in the minds of many,
as to Sverre's origin, was in itself demoralizing. It
destroyed that bond of loyalty which had hitherto
bound the people to the descendants of Harold the
Fairhaired, and made it easy for unscrupulous pretenders,
by the prospect of booty, to entice men into
rebellion. We see, therefore, during Sverre's reign
and that of his immediate successors, an abundant
crop of pretenders and rebellious bands start up in
different parts of the country, only to be cut down
after a more or less extended existence by the constituted
authority.</p>

<p>That Sverre, in a measure, had himself to thank
for this state of things he must have been well
aware; and the frequency of his insistence upon
his mission to deliver Norway from the illegal sway
of Erling Skakke's son shows how anxious he was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
lest the same thought should occur to others. Even
though he was the son of Sigurd Mouth (which, is indeed,
probable), he must have seen that the people
were suffering no hardships from Magnus' mild exercise
of his power, while the wars which were directly
and indirectly inflicted upon the realm by his own
pretendership shook it to its very core. In the r&ocirc;le
of a deliverer Sverre was therefore scarcely sincere,
and a certain insecurity in his position, springing,
perhaps, from an inward doubt, made him at times
appear with less dignity than we might expect in a
man of his genius and power. Thus, when in 1181
a man named Erik, whose origin seems wrapped in
obscurity, obtained permission to prove by ordeal
that he was Sigurd Mouth's son, Sverre insisted upon
inserting in his oath the words "and Sverre's brother,"
thereby obtaining, as it were, a surreptitious proof of
his own descent from the royal house. Erik, however,
objected to assuming this double responsibility,
but succeeded in proving the truth of his assertion
in regard to himself. He was from this time named
Erik Kingsson; but pledged himself never to aspire
to the crown. Sverre gave him first command of his
household troops and made him later Earl of Viken.</p>

<p>Sverre's first endeavor, after having become sole
ruler in the land, was to strengthen the foundation
of his throne. An alliance with the aristocracy who
had hitherto wielded the greatest influence was out of
the question, first because the magnates had been the
partisans of Magnus, and secondly, because to the
Birchlegs, to whom Sverre owed his power, such an
alliance would have been odious. He therefore de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>termined
to seek the supports of his kingship among
the same class, from which his Birchlegs had come,
viz., the tenants, small farmers, and, in general,
among the lower strata of the population. These
men had hitherto been at the mercy of the chieftains;
and though it was in the interest of the latter
not to injure or maltreat them, their position was
one of dependence and penury. They were practically
beyond the pale of the law; because, if wronged
by one of their superiors they lacked the means and
influence to prosecute him at the <i>thing</i>. In order to
improve the position of these lowly people and
thereby gain their friendship, Sverre appointed a
new class of officers, the so-called lawmen, whose
business it should be to procure justice for the
oppressed at small expense and without delay. As
one of the first appointed lawmen, Gunnar Grjonbak
in Tr&ouml;ndelag, said: "King Sverre, when he gave me
this office, bade me administer justice among cottagers,
not among chieftains." The lawmen were
thus judges who, backed by the authority of the
crown, were charged with the interests of the small,
both in their mutual quarrels and in their quarrels
with the great. That their appointment was a
shrewd act, on Sverre's part, is obvious.</p>

<p>Another class of officers who, though they were
not first appointed by Sverre, had more definite
functions and duties assigned to them by him,
were the prefects (<i>syslu-madr</i><a name="FNanchor_A_60" id="FNanchor_A_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_60" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>). They were not,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>like the liegemen, royal vassals who held land in fief
and exercised independent authority, but servants of
the king and the representatives of his power.<a name="FNanchor_B_61" id="FNanchor_B_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_61" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> They
collected the royal revenues in their districts, and
watched over the interests of the crown. They thus
deprived the liegemen of their principal functions
and a large share of their income. As a measure intended
to weaken the influence of the aristocracy,
the appointment of these prefects was therefore most
effective. Sverre was not minded to share his power
with these haughty magnates, many of whom had
not hesitated to barter away provinces and enter into
alliances with foreign princes against their own king.
He wished the crown to be strong enough to curb
this unruly element, and by the aid of the small prevent
the great from growing above his head. With
great shrewdness and statesmanlike insight he began
this work, which in one way or another absorbed his
time and energy during his entire reign.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_60" id="Footnote_A_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_60"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Vigfusson translates <i>syslu-madr</i>, "prefect, bailiff, king's steward";
but he also translates <i>gjald-keri</i> and <i>ar-madr</i> with steward,
and in this case correctly. The only English term I know for an officer
whose functions correspond approximately to those of the <i>syslu-madr</i>

<p>Seeing that the king meant to deprive them of
their ancient privileges, the remnants of the liegemen's
party began to look about for a new pretender,
whom they could put in the field against
Sverre. Such a one was soon found in the person of
a monk named Jon, who professed to be a son of
King Inge Crookback. Though his story was evidently
mendacious, there gathered about him a
considerable band, which received the name Kuvlungs
or Cowlmen. Not all the former adherents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
of Magnus did, by any means, join this band, but
yet a sufficient number to make it formidable. Now
began the usual depredations along the coast, attacks
upon Bergen and Nidaros, indecisive fights and sudden
retreats, occasional victories, and a great deal of
destructive guerilla warfare. There was a suspicion
that Archbishop Eystein, who hated Sverre, was the
power that kept the Kuvlungs in motion, and it was
obvious that he secretly favored them. The archbishop,
however, died in 1188 having, as Sverre asserted,
made peace with him on his death-bed. Soon
after, the rebel band was destroyed in Bergen (1188)
and their leader slain.</p>

<p>If Sverre had expected to sit at ease in the enjoyment
of his power, he must by this time have been
undeceived. He had indeed sown the wind, and
he reaped the whirlwind. No sooner were the Kuvlungs
out of the way than a new band, called the
Varbelgs (Wolf Skins), was organized by the chieftain
Simon Kaaresson, who picked up a pretender in the
person of a child, named Vikar. This boy, who was
but a few years old, was born in Denmark, and was
alleged to be a son of King Magnus Erlingsson. But
the deception was a little too barefaced to gain credence,
and the Varbelgs came to an inglorious end at
Bristein, near Tunsberg (1190), where both the little
Vikar and Simon Kaaresson were slain. Rebellion
had by this time grown so popular that any plausible
impostor, who chose to take the risks, might expect
to gain a considerable number of adherents. The
many who were unable or indisposed to put up with
the new order of things, preferred to stake all on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
desperate chance rather than submit meekly to the
terms of Sverre's amnesty. It was, therefore, of
small consequence who headed the rebellion; the
rebellious spirit which was abroad was sure to find
expression, and was never in want of a leader. The
successors of the Varbelgs were called Oyeskeggs
(the Islanders), because their band was recruited
largely from the Orkneys, where Earl Harold favored
them. Their chieftains were Hallkel Jonsson,
a brother-in-law of King Magnus, Sigurd Jarlsson, an
illegitimate son of Erling Skakke, and Olaf, a brother-in-law
of Earl Harold, of the Orkneys. All these had
nominally submitted to Sverre and had received
many favors at his hands. Nay, even after they
had hatched their conspiracy, Olaf continued to act
as the king's friend and sit at his table. Sverre was,
however, not deceived by his duplicity. One day
when they were talking together the king said:
"Thou, Olaf, oughtest to have been faithful to
me."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that, my lord?" asked Olaf.</p>

<p>The king, instead of answering directly, made a
thrust with his knife in the air and said: "The followers
of our foes are now swarming about us."</p>

<p>At this the traitor took alarm and quickly left the
hall. Outside he met his foster-son Sigurd, who was
said to be a son of King Magnus, and was later
pushed into the r&ocirc;le of a pretender by the Oyeskeggs.</p>

<p>"There we narrowly escaped a trap, foster-son,"
said he, as he took the boy by the hand and hurried
away. He immediately set sail for the Shetland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Islands, where he could mature his plans without
interference. In the summer of 1193 he appeared
with Hallkel and Sigurd Jarlsson and a large flock of
rebels in Viken, where shire after shire submitted to
them without resistance. There were, probably, no
royal troops in Viken at this time, and the inhabitants,
who had formerly been partisans of King
Magnus, had not recently acquired any deep sense
of loyalty to Sverre. When provisions became
scarce, the rebel chieftains went aboard their ships
and began to prey upon the shipping in the Belts.
In this way they gained such large amounts of goods
and money that they became known as the "Goldlegs"
(<i>Gullbeiner</i>). In the autumn of 1193 they
sailed northward, full of courage, hoping soon to
make an end of Sverre, who was understood to have
but few people about him. They met him at Florsvaag,
near Bergen, and prepared for battle. His
force amounted to about twelve hundred men, while
the Oyeskeggs had two thousand. As it was too
late to fight, when the fleets first approached each
other, Sverre betook himself to the city with a few
followers in order to get reinforcements. On his
way back, it occurred to him that it might be a good
plan to pay the rebels a visit. In a small boat he
rowed stealthily, under cover of the darkness, up to
the ship where the chieftains were having a council
of war, and had the pleasure of hearing Hallkel
Jonsson unfold the whole plan of the battle. He
took his own measures accordingly, and by his well-calculated
man&#339;uvres frustrated their plans. The
battle was, however, a bloody one, and fiercely con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>tested.
It looked badly for the Birchlegs for a
while, but the arrival of ninety well-armed men from
the city decided the day in Sverre's favor. The king
of the Oyeskeggs leaped overboard, but was pierced
by a spear while he was swimming shoreward. All
the rebel chieftains, except Sigurd Jarlsson, and
nearly all the men were slain (1194).</p>

<p>While thus indefatigably engaged in quelling rebellion,
Sverre had another struggle on his hands
which made even heavier demands upon his vigilance
and energy. The church is not apt to look with favor
upon one who deserts it, even for a throne, and the
fact that the king had been admitted to the lowest
order of the priesthood, so far from reconciling the
priests to his authority, placed them in a hostile attitude
to him. In spite of this, however, there is little
doubt but that he could have bought their friendship
by making the proper concessions. If he had been
willing to ratify the agreement between Archbishop
Eystein and Erling Skakke, hold his crown in fief
from St. Olaf, which was but another name for the
hierarchy, and give the bishops the right to exact
similar conditions from his successors, his former
deaconship would have proved no obstacle to his
receiving the support of the Church. Sverre knew,
however, too well the spirit of the priesthood to
venture upon such concessions. It was his policy to
make the monarchy strong enough to quell the unruly
spirit of the aristocracy and give peace and
security to the people. The Church had from the
beginning taken sides against him, and secretly or
openly aided every band of rebels which had endeav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>ored
to overthrow his government. No wonder that,
apart from all other considerations, he was not favorably
disposed toward the Church.</p>

<p>When Archbishop Eystein died, after having
made a pretended peace with the king, Bishop Erik,
of Stavanger, was elected as his successor. It is
said that Eystein, on his death-bed, obtained
Sverre's reluctant consent to this choice. At all
events, Erik was chosen, and was no sooner warm in
his seat, than he showed his disposition toward the
king. Without consulting Sverre, he named for his
successor to the bishopric of Stavanger one of his bitterest
enemies, Nicholas Arnesson, a half-brother of
King Inge Crookback. Sverre naturally objected,
first because Nicholas had never taken orders, secondly
because his election had taken place in an
illegal manner, the king having not been present. For
all that, he agreed in the end to waive his objections,
because his queen, Margaret (a sister of the Swedish
king, Knut Eriksson), interposed in Nicholas' behalf.
The latter, who was a master of intrigue, had,
by his humility and flatteries, gained the favor of
the queen, and even Sverre, who was ordinarily a
keen judge of men, was made to waver in his distrust
of him. He was, however, soon to have his
eyes opened. As soon as Nicholas had received his
investiture, he again joined the ranks of the king's
enemies, making common cause with the archbishop,
who was indefatigably quarrelling with Sverre about
the alleged prerogatives of his office. First, he
wanted the fines and penances, payable to the Church
in Tr&ouml;ndelag, to be rendered according to actual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
weight in silver, and not in the coin of the realm,
which was but worth half its nominal value. Secondly,
he wished to reserve for himself and his fellow
bishops the right of making all clerical appointments,
and thirdly, he claimed the privilege of
surrounding himself with a kind of ecclesiastical
court, and keeping ninety to one hundred men-at-arms
in his service, although the law only allowed
him thirty. To settle these points, Sverre summoned
the archbishop to Frosta-<i>thing</i>, and, after
having read him the law, decided against him. Full
of wrath, the haughty prelate left the country, seeking
refuge with Archbishop Absalon in Denmark,
who received him cordially. Here he composed a
letter to the Pope in which he bitterly complained
of the king's usurpations and infringements of the
rights of the Church. The Pope responded by putting
Sverre in the ban and releasing his subjects
from their oath of allegiance. Before the bull
reached Norway, however, Sverre had induced the
bishops, remaining in the country, to crown him at
Bergen (June 29, 1194). Even Bishop Nicholas,
who had recently been transferred from Stavanger
to Oslo, had participated in this ceremony, though
probably much against his will. Sverre treated the
papal bull, at first, as a mere fraudulent invention of
archbishops, Erik and Absalon, but that he was far
from believing this to be the case is shown by the
fact that he sent embassadors to Rome to present
counter charges against the archbishop, and to explain
the causes of the controversy from his point of view.
As far as we know these embassadors accomplished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
nothing, and on their homeward way they died suddenly
in Denmark (1197), having probably been
poisoned. Soon after, a falsified papal bull was published
by Sverre, in which the ban was revoked. It
is not improbable that he was himself responsible
for this falsification. It was a question of "to be or
not to be" with him, and he had been long enough
connected with the Church to know how to soothe
his conscience in such a matter. It is, moreover,
scarcely credible that any one else would have committed
the fraud in his favor.</p>

<p>Seeing that they could not destroy Sverre by
spiritual weapons only, his enemies resorted once
more to the sword, and this time chance played into
their hands in a most remarkable manner. The
Byzantine emperor Alexius sent, in 1195, a Norseman
named Reidar the Messenger (<i>Sendemand</i>), to
Norway to hire him 200 mercenaries, and Sverre,
though he was of opinion that Norway had no troops
to spare, was persuaded to permit the emperor's
emissary to enlist such as desired to follow him. Reidar
went to work without delay and gathered a considerable
force, but in the meanwhile Bishop Nicholas
had approached him and induced him to enter
into a league for the overthrow of Sverre's government.
Next to Nicholas himself, the most important
man in the league was Sigurd Jarlsson, the son of
Erling Skakke, and formerly a chief of the Oyeskeggs.
A boy named Inge, alleged to be the son
of King Magnus Erlingsson, was their candidate
for the throne. The band received the name of
<i>Bagler</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, Crookmen, after <i>bagall</i>, a crook or bish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>op's
staff. They were, owing to the accession of
Reidar's mercenaries, much more formidable than
any of the former bands which had risen in rebellion
against Sverre. In the first battle which the
king fought with them, they had no less than 125
ships and 5,000 men. This encounter, which took
place in Salt&ouml; Sound, in Viken (1196), was indecisive,
though some advantage seems to have been
gained by the Baglers. At all events, Sverre dared
not remain in Viken, but steered northward to Nidaros,
leaving the rebels masters of all the southern
provinces. They had here the sympathy of the population,
and experienced no difficulty in having the
pretender Inge proclaimed king at Borgar-<i>thing</i>.
Sverre, in the meanwhile, levied troops in the northern
provinces, and in the summer of 1197 attacked
the rebels at Oslo, where they suffered a crushing
defeat. Here his prudent foresight and strategic
skill insured him a splendid success, while Nicholas
showed himself a cowardly braggart, devoid of generalship.
He tried to make his men believe that the
swords of the Birchlegs would not bite, because they
were in the ban, and when this lie had been effectually
disproved, the bishop was among the first to
take to his heels.</p>

<p>"Ride forth hard now, my lord," one of the Baglers
called to him. "Our men sorely need your help
and exhortation; for, methinks, in sooth, that the
swords of the Birchlegs bite pretty well."</p>

<p>"No, let us ride away as fast as we can," Nicholas
made answer; "for now the Devil is loose."</p>

<p>After the battle the prelate sent a priest to Sverre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
with offers of peace; but the latter, who knew the
treacherous character of his foe, would not treat
with him, unless he appeared in person. He promised
him safe-conduct, averring that he had other
means of gaining fame than by killing a man like
him. Nicholas made no response to this proposition;
but instead of presenting himself before the
king, hastened with his men overland to Nidaros,
attacked the city, burned Sverre's fleet, which was
lying in the fjord, and besieged the block-house,
which finally fell by the treason of its commander,
Thorstein Kugad. This was a severe blow to the
king, and placed him in the subsequent contest at a
great disadvantage. To meet the rebels on the sea
with the small ships which were now left to him, was
hazardous, as the battle of Thorsberg, near the mouth
of the Drontheim fjord, during the following year
plainly showed (1198). The Birchlegs were here
worsted, in spite of their splendid bravery, and many
of the king's staunchest friends and adherents were
slain. Sverre hastened thence to Bergen, where the
Bagler chief, Sigurd Jarlsson, in the meanwhile had
been raging with fire and sword. He had burned
those of Sverre's ships which he had found in the
harbor, as well as the houses of the Birchlegs in the
city, and he now laid siege to the block-house, where
Queen Margaret was with all her household. As
this rude fort was built of wood, his first intention
was to fire it, and he began, for this purpose, to pile
up wood for an enormous bonfire close to the walls.
Sigurd Borgarklett, the commander of the fort, succeeded
in lighting the wood-pile, before it was large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>enough to do any harm. The Baglers began to pile
up wood once more, but again the besieged flung
burning barrels of tar down upon them and drove
them off. After many fruitless attempts, Sigurd
Jarlsson gave up the plan of firing the block-house.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus391.jpg" width="367" height="500" alt="THORGH&Auml;TTEN, A FAMOUS ISLAND WITH A NATURAL TUNNEL, IN NORDLAND." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">THORGH&Auml;TTEN, A FAMOUS ISLAND WITH A NATURAL TUNNEL, IN NORDLAND.</span>
</div>

<p>It was not, however, only his enemies without, who
gave Sigurd Borgarklett trouble. The queen, at the
sight of the fire, grew frantic and insisted upon surrendering;
and all her women surrounded the brave
commander, tearfully imploring him not to expose
them to being burned alive. A friend of Sverre,
named Aura-Paul, to whose care the queen had
especially been entrusted, feared that the lamentations
of the women might have a discouraging effect
upon the garrison, and in order to save the commander
from their importunities, he persuaded them
to enter the room above the gate, which had been
used as a jail, and there await the issue of the negotiations
with the Baglers. To this they readily consented;
and were forthwith locked up, with full
permission to wail to their hearts' content. When,
however, the danger from fire was past, Aura-Paul
went to the queen and asked her, what she would
give him if he could induce the Baglers to depart.
She offered him a great sum of money; whereupon
he begged the loan of her seal. He now sat down
and wrote a letter in the queen's name to two priests
in the city, urging them to use every means in their
power to detain the enemy, as the king was coming
with a large force the next day and would be sure to
make an end of them. This communication he
despatched by a small boy who managed to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
caught by the Baglers and, on being searched, had to
deliver up the letter. Sigurd Jarlsson, without suspecting
the deceit, hurried away as fast as he could,
not, however, without having punished the two
priests, who, though professing friendship for him,
yet were in communication with the queen. This
was regarded by the Birchlegs as a delightful joke;
for the priests were, like most of their order, enemies
of the king. But to make this comedy of errors
complete, Sverre did actually, to the surprise of his
friends, arrive on the day appointed in the letter.
Nevertheless, it was fortunate that Sigurd Jarlsson
had taken to his heels; for the main force of the
Baglers were pursuing the king southward, and if the
two divisions had effected a junction in Bergen,
Sverre would scarcely have been able to hold his
own against them.</p>

<p>The summer of 1198, which became known among
the people as the Bergen summer, was passed by the
hostile armies in and about the latter city, and there
was almost an incessant skirmishing, besides some
hard fighting. A battle at the Jonvolds resulted in
favor of the Birchlegs, but was not decisive enough
to destroy the Baglers' power of resistance.</p>

<p>The summer passed, neither party gaining any decided
advantage. Then Bishop Nicholas, despairing of
destroying the Birchlegs as long as they had the town
to fall back upon, determined to deprive them of this
shelter. He accordingly set fire to the town and
burned the greater part of it. The Birchlegs had
enough to do in saving the block-house, and could
give but little aid to the citizens in their efforts to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
limit the conflagration. It is doubtful, however, if
the Baglers gained any thing by this unwarrantable
destruction, for the citizens of Bergen, a large number
of whom had been favorably inclined toward
them, became from this day their enemies. Sverre
was, indeed, compelled to abandon his position, leaving,
however, a garrison in the block-house. But the
Baglers scarcely profited by his departure, as the
country round about had been denuded of provisions,
and want compelled them to move. Bishop
Nicholas then sailed northward to Nordm&ouml;re and
Haalogaland, where he met with no opposition; and
desertion from the ranks of the Birchlegs increased
his army until its very magnitude caused him embarrassment.
Oddly enough, at this very time, when the
king's fortune was at its lowest ebb, the traitor,
Thorstein Kugad, who had surrendered the block-house
in Nidaros, returned to him. He flung himself
at Sverre's feet, embraced his knees, and cried:</p>

<p>"Happy I am now, my lord, that I am so near
you&mdash;that I can touch you. * * * Dear my lord,
receive me, and let me never more part from you."</p>

<p>Though his former comrades demanded his death,
Sverre gave him full pardon. The king's desperate
position was indeed sufficient guaranty of the sincerity
of Thorstein's repentance. The whole country,
outside of Tr&ouml;ndelag, was now in the hands of
the rebels. The royal fleet was burned, and even
many of the veteran Birchlegs had deserted. Then,
as the final crushing blow, came the bull of Pope Innocent
III., laying the country under interdict, prohibiting
the celebration of public worship and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
administration of the sacraments, in all those parts
of the kingdom that yet remained faithful to Sverre.
If the vicar of Christ had contented himself with
hurling the thunderbolt of divine wrath against the
king, he might perhaps have achieved his destruction.
But the Pope, finding that the bull of his
predecessor had been practically ineffective, aimed
this time to affect the popular conscience, and he
addressed to it certain arguments which showed
how completely he had allowed himself to be deceived
by Sverre's enemies. In his bull he described
the king in a manner which must have appeared absurd
to those who knew him; he attributed to him
crimes which all knew that he had never committed;
and exposed thereby&mdash;not Sverre's wickedness, but
his own fallibility and partisanship. The king, instead
of meekly submitting to an unfair sentence,
felt, therefore, justified in coming forward in his
own defence. He wrote or caused to be written,
under his immediate supervision, a polemical brochure,
in which he reviewed his relation to the
Church and ably defended his conduct. The behavior
of the clergy he subjected to a scathing
criticism, showed the inconsistency of their position,
as the partisans of Baglers, and exposed the true motive
of their actions. The author's shrewdness, ability,
and learning are manifest in every page, and the
lucidity of expression and the plain common-sense
arguments seem to reveal the well-known personality
of Sverre. That it had the effect of preventing many
from leaving him, who otherwise might have been
frightened into desertion, is very probable. The dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>loyal
clergy had, however, better facilities for reaching
the people than the few who were yet faithful,
and they improved their opportunity in inciting the
peasants to an unreasoning, fanatical hostility to the
excommunicated king. The Pope, in the meanwhile,
was active in stirring up foreign enemies against him,
and wrote the most urgent letters to the kings of
Sweden and Denmark, exhorting them to merit the
gratitude of God and his vicar, the Pope, by destroying
the sacrilegious monster, Sverre. Happily, these
exhortations had no effect; for King Knut of Denmark
had his hands full at home, and King Sverke
of Sweden was rather favorably inclined toward his
neighbor.</p>

<p>In this desperate strait Sverre's true greatness revealed
itself. He had been accustomed to fight
against heavy odds, and the sense of danger served
to bring all his energies into play. With undaunted
resolution he set to work to repair his losses and to
equip himself once more to meet his foes. His first
task was to build a fleet instead of the one which the
Baglers had destroyed; for without ships he would
have been at their mercy. The Tr&ouml;nders whom he
called upon for help assisted him faithfully; and by
the beginning of spring (1199) he had eight large
galleys ready to be launched. Besides these he expected
a number of others which the peasants were
building for him throughout Tr&ouml;ndelag. The city
of Nidaros he fortified with a large new block-house,
and built hurling-machines which were used for
throwing stones at the enemy. Early in June the
Baglers appeared in the fjord with a large fleet, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the usual skirmishing commenced. All their efforts
to capture the city were, however, unavailing, and
in the battle at Strinds&ouml; (June, 1199) their great
fleet, which had formerly given them an advantage
over the Birchlegs, fell into Sverre's hands. The
battle was stubbornly contested, and both parties
were wrought up to a warlike fury which refused to
give or to take quarter. The king, whose gentleness
and humane sentiments had made his stern resolution
and courage the more admirable, put here a blot
upon his fair name. He yielded to the importunities
of his men, and allowed them to avenge the death of
their kinsman upon the prisoners. It is but fair to
ascribe this single act of cruelty to the momentary
ferment of his blood and the hate that flared up uncontrollably
against the authors of all his misfortunes.</p>

<p>After the battle of Strinds&ouml; the Baglers fled
southward with the few ships that were left to them,
and were pursued by Sverre, who did not, however,
succeed in overtaking them. They found, as usual,
a refuge in Denmark, where they continued to plot
mischief. They felt themselves, in point of strength
and resources, so superior to Sverre that it seemed
to them merely a question of time, when they should
gain possession of the entire land. Even in Nidaros,
where the king was yet able to hold his own, the
rebels had many sympathizers among the clergy.
After his victory at Strinds&ouml;, Sverre sailed southward
and went into winter-quarters in Oslo. The
Baglers took advantage of his absence to visit Nidaros
where they fought indecisively with an army of 1,800
peasants who undertook to defend the city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
In the meanwhile a storm was drawing up over
Sverre's head more menacing than any which he had
hitherto weathered. The preaching of the disloyal
clergy was beginning to show its effects. The peasants
of Viken and the Oplands rose in rebellion, and
poured in great torrents toward Oslo, for the purpose
of destroying the excommunicated king. From
three different directions their armies came marching,
intending to effect a junction near the city, and
by their greatly superior numbers overwhelm Sverre.
The king had then only three thousand men, while
the forces of the peasants, all told, must have numbered
forty or fifty thousand. To fight against
such odds would seem to be simple madness. Nevertheless
he determined to sell his life dearly. Never
did his genius shine more brightly than in the hour
of danger. Calmly and confidently he addressed his
men, assigning to each commander his task, and exhorting
his Birchlegs to be brave, and to trust in
God. Then, by a series of swift man&#339;uvres, he prevented
the junction of the hostile armies, leaving
his sons, Sigurd Lavard and Haakon, to guard his
rear, while he engaged and defeated the two main
divisions of the peasant army. The force under
Sigurd and Haakon, which only numbered four hundred
and eighty men, had in the meanwhile been
routed by the third division, numbering twenty-four
hundred, and the king would have had small chance
of escape, if the peasants had had the wit to follow
up their advantage. Instead of that they began
carousing in the city, and even refrained from firing
the royal fleet, which was in their power, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>they regarded it already as their own. When, however,
the sanguinary battle which was in progress
out on the ice was at an end, the hilarious peasants
discovered their mistake. Sverre came, not as vanquished,
but as victor. Then there was hurly-burly
of battle once more&mdash;fight, flight, and pursuit. The
yeomen, sturdy fellows though they were, and not
unaccustomed to war, lacked discipline, and above
all they lacked a competent commander. Sverre
chased them so hotly that they had to fling away
their shields and trust for safety to their speed alone.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">H&Ouml;NEFOSS.</span>
</div>

<p>The exhausted Birchlegs had now need of rest,
and the king ordered the famous <i>loor</i> Andvake to be
blown, and gathered the army about him. Food and
drink were brought from the city and the hungry
warriors were about to refresh themselves, when they
perceived that the fugitives of the several peasant
armies had united, and were returning to challenge
once more the fortune of battle. The rebels had
discovered that they were yet, with a proper plan of
attack, formidable enough to destroy the Birchlegs.
Their chief purpose now was to kill Sverre, because
they supposed that if he were dead, the resistance of
his party would soon collapse. Reluctant though
they were to fight again, the Birchlegs responded
bravely to their king's exhortation. They stormed
down to the frozen fjord, where the peasants were
forming their battle line, and made a fierce onset.
Sverre, as was his wont, rode about among them,
was now at the front, now in the rear, and with his
clear eye directed each man&#339;uvre. The peasants,
when they saw him, cried out: "Stab him, hew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
him down, kill him, cut his horse from under
him." And from all sides resounded hoarsely the
shout: "Stab him, kill him." But in their eagerness
to slay Sverre, they neglected to preserve order.
Their battle array broke up into a series of wild and
irregular charges, the weak points of which Sverre
was not slow to detect. The Birchlegs rushed in
among them and routed them with great carnage.
A liegeman, named Aale Hallvardsson, whom the
rebels mistook for the king, because he was similarly
dressed, fell after a brave defence, and an exultant
shout was heard, that the king was slain. The Birchlegs
were for a moment stricken with terror, and
stopped in their pursuit. But suddenly Sverre came
dashing forward on his horse; the warriors rallied
joyously about him, the <i>loor</i> was blown for a fresh
attack, and at the head of his men the king charged
once more and broke the last resistance of the discomfited
peasants.</p>

<p>This was the greatest victory that Sverre ever
won, and altogether one of the most extraordinary
battles ever fought in Norway. For the peasants a
day of accounting was now at hand, and the king
made them feel the heavy hand of his wrath. A
policy of gentleness and amnesty they would have
mistaken for fear; only severity could inspire
them with respect. Many farms were burned and
great fines in money and provisions were exacted
from those who had taken part in the rebellion. One
incident will suffice to show, however, how little
Sverre's heart was in this work. As he was approaching
a farm, a little boy came running out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
woods and begged him piteously not to burn his
home.</p>

<p>"Nay, surely it shall be spared, since thou askest,"
answered Sverre, gently; "and if the peasants had
stayed at home and begged for peace, no farm would
have been burned. Tell them now, that the rest will
be spared."</p>

<p>Forthwith he gave orders to his men to refrain
from further destruction.</p>

<p>The heroic endurance which Sverre had developed
in this long and exhausting struggle had indeed
weakened the cause of the Baglers, but had by no
means deprived them of their courage. A civil war
and particularly a war of classes, such as this was,
arouses fiercer hates and passions than international
contests, and must therefore continue, until one party
or the other is utterly humbled or destroyed. The
Norse magnates, who formed the bone and sinew of
the Bagler party, hated Sverre, not only because they
believed him to be an upstart and an adventurer, but
as the destroyer of the old oligarchic government, in
which they had secured the lion's share of power. A
class, so formidably intrenched both in the institutions
and the traditions of the country, could not be
overthrown at one blow; nor could it be humbled
by misfortunes and reverses. It was not in his clerical
capacity, but as the most eminent representative
of the old aristocracy, that Bishop Nicholas became
their leader; and the adherence of the clergy to the
Bagler party was not so much the result of a personal
sympathy with him, as of a common animosity to
the democratic king, the leveller of distinctions, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
champion of the rabble. These proud descendants
of the great historic families of Norway were of the
same blood as the Norman nobility of England,
and though they did not live in castles, nor dress in
satin and ermine, yet they were animated by the same
spirit. They were ready to fight for their rights,
whether real or imagined, even against their own
king and country.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1201 Sverre called fresh levies
from the ever faithful North, and sailed again southward,
leaving a garrison in Bergen under the command
of his friend, Dagfinn Peasant, and his son-in-law
Einar, surnamed the Priest. He learned that
the Bagler chief, Reidar Messenger, with about two
hundred and forty men had taken possession of the
block-house at Tunsberg, and he thought the opportunity
a favorable one for annihilating one of his
most dangerous enemies. To this end he laid siege
to the block-house, which, however, from its situation
on the mountain, overlooking the town, was wellnigh
impregnable. His attempt to take it by storm
failed, and his various ingenious stratagems were likewise
unsuccessful. After a siege of twenty weeks,
the Baglers were reduced to such a strait that for
their Christmas dinner they had to eat boiled and
chopped ropes, made out of walrus and sealskin.
They could not endure this long; one by one they
began to desert, in the dead of night, and instead of
being slain, as they expected, they were received
with kindness by the king. The Birchlegs grumbled
loudly at his forbearance, but he rebuked them
sternly, and they had to own that he was right. Last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of all came Reidar Messenger with the little band
that had remained with him. Sverre not only spared
his life, but he treated him with the greatest consideration.
He warned the Baglers not to eat too
heartily after their long fast, and cared for those
among them who were ill. Many who disregarded
his advice died; while others dragged themselves
through life with ruined health. The chief himself
also suffered much, although Sverre exerted all his
medical skill to cure him.</p>

<p>The incessant hardships of war and the strain
upon his energies which they involved had, in the
meanwhile, undermined the king's strength, and he
was after a while compelled to take to his bed.
When he left Tunsberg in January or February, 1202,
he had his bed made on the raised poop of the deck,
and that of the Bagler chief was placed at his side.
And there lay, side by side, the conqueror and
the conquered, gazing up into the wintry sky, and
watching the clouds that chased each other under
the wind-swept vault. Often they talked pleasantly
together, and each learned to admire the remarkable
qualities of the other. Reidar, who had
been a crusader, told of his adventures and observations
in Constantinople, and the Holy Land; and
the days passed quickly to the king, while he listened
to the entertaining narrative. On the arrival of the
fleet in Bergen, the king was moved to the royal
mansion where his bed was made in the great hall.
When he felt that his death was near, he called some
of his trusted friends to him and declared solemnly,
in their presence, that he had but one son living,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
namely Haakon, and if any one else claimed to be
his son, he was a rebel, and an impostor. Then he
ordered a letter, which he had dictated to Haakon, to
be read and sealed, and he charged his nephews,
Haakon Galen, and Peter Steyper, to deliver it into
his hands.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "before receiving the extreme
unction, to be lifted into my high-seat, and there
await life or death."</p>

<p>When the sacrament, in spite of his excommunication,
had been administered to him, he continued:
"My kingship has brought me more tribulation, disquietude,
and danger, than ease and pleasure, and
methinks that mere envy has impelled many to become
my enemies, which sin may God now forgive
them, and judge between them and me and in my
whole cause."</p>

<p>King Sverre expired March 9th, 1202. He was
in point of genius the greatest king who has ever
ruled over Norway. A bright, clear, and resolute
spirit dwelt within his small frame. His presence of
mind and his wonderful fertility of resource saved
him out of the most desperate situations. Firmness,
and gentleness were admirably united in his character.
A clear-sighted policy, based upon expediency
as well as upon conviction, governed his actions
from the beginning of his reign to its end. He possessed
the faculty of attaching men to him, even
when he punished them and restrained their lawless
passions. Though he did not possess the beauty or
the magnificent physical presence of the earlier kings
of Norway, he knew how to inspire respect as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
as love. The charm of his conversation, and his affability
of manner impressed every one who came in
contact with him. "What especially makes his personality
interesting," says Munch,<a name="FNanchor_A_62" id="FNanchor_A_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_62" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> "is the remarkable
mingling of seriousness and humor, which seems
to be peculiar to the Norse national character, and
which, in his demeanor, was so striking that he may
almost be regarded as its embodiment."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_62" id="Footnote_A_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_62"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Munch, iii., 391.</p></div>

<p>In many respects he was much in advance of his
age. Thus, it is told of him that, so far from regarding
the national vice, drunkeness, as an amiable
weakness, for which no man was any the worse, he
endeavored earnestly to check it, and punished with
severity those who committed excesses under the influence
of drink. As far as his constant occupation
with war permitted him, he encouraged trade and
all industrial pursuits. For learning he had a high
regard; was himself a good Latin scholar and well
read in the law, and displayed much zeal in procuring
for his sons the best educational advantages that
the time afforded. In spite of the hardships and
dangers, to which he was constantly exposed, he lived
to be fifty years old,&mdash;an age which, since the death of
Harold the Fairhaired, but one king of Norway had
reached.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>HAAKON SVERRESSON (1202-1204).</h3>


<p>In his dying message to his son Sverre advised
him to make peace with the Church. He foresaw
that the interdict which was weighing heavily upon
the land would be an increasingly powerful weapon
in the hands of the Baglers, and would continue to
alienate the hearts of the people from the king.
Haakon, who had not personally been engaged in
the controversy, could, without loss of dignity, make
overtures for a reconciliation, and might, if necessary,
make concessions. The bishops were, however,
so tired of their long exile and dependence upon
foreign bounty, that they accepted with eagerness
his offer of peace and hastened to return to their
bishoprics. What the terms of the reconciliation
were we do not know. The old Archbishop Erik,
who was now blind and decrepit, was especially glad
to return home, as his patron, Archbishop Absalon,
had recently died, and his position in Denmark, as a
dependent of the king, was scarcely an agreeable
one. No sooner had he set foot on Norse soil than
he declared the interdict revoked, without even
awaiting the Pope's consent&mdash;a rashness for which
he was later rebuked by Innocent III. The Pope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
however, though he no doubt enjoyed wielding the
tremendous weapons of his wrath, acquiesced in the
terms of the peace, and had no fault to find with the
new king's attitude toward the Church. The fact
was, Haakon Sverresson was a gentle and lovable
character, who delighted in peace rather than war.
All the people, weary of the long and bloody civil
feud, felt drawn toward him and hastened to acknowledge
him. After his proclamation as king at
Oere-<i>thing</i>, and the revocation of the interdict, he
was undisputed master of the land; and the star of
the Baglers seemed forever to have set. Many of
their influential chiefs deserted to Haakon; and their
so-called king, Inge, was slain on an island in
Mj&ouml;sen by his own men and the peasants. Bishop
Nicholas exchanged temporarily the helmet for the
mitre, and kept as quiet as his restlessly intriguing
mind would permit. Reidar Messenger had, after
his capitulation at Tunsberg, sworn fidelity to Sverre,
and meant to keep faith with his son. It seemed
therefore that, at last, all dangers were removed, and
that the young and popular king had a prospect of
a long and happy reign. Then, as a bolt of lightning
out of a sunny sky, came a calamity which suddenly
plunged the country again into war and misery.</p>

<p>We have heard that Sverre married Margaret, the
daughter of the Swedish king, Erik the Saint. He
had with her no sons, but a daughter, Christina. His
two sons, Sigurd Lavard, who died before his father,
and Haakon, were born on the Faeroe Isles; and
their mother was Astrid, the daughter of Bishop
Roe. It is probable that Sverre was married to her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
but it is told that he did not bring her to Norway,
because she had been unfaithful to him. According
to a tradition, however, she was brought to
Norway by her son, who gave her a large estate near
Nidaros and treated her with consideration and
kindness. This act Haakon's step-mother, the queen-dowager
Margaret, regarded as an insult to her, and
determined to leave the country. Being a passionate
and imperious woman, proud of her birth and
relentless in her hate, she imagined that she was not
accorded the honor that was her due at the court,
and she particularly took offence because the king
claimed precedence before her. Being averse to
strife, he did his best to conciliate her, but with
small success. The queen-dowager betook herself
to Oslo with her daughter, intending thence to proceed
to Sweden, where she owned large estates. The
king, though he did not dispute her right to leave,
denied her right to take with her his half-sister,
whose natural guardian he was; and sent his cousin,
Peter Steyper, to induce her to desist from her resolution.
The queen, however, remained obdurate.
She would not concede that Haakon had any right
over her child. Finding threats and persuasion unavailing,
Peter Steyper attempted a stratagem. He
burst into the princess' room, while her mother was
taking a bath, crying at the top of his voice that the
Baglers had come to town. Christina implored him
in terror to save her; whereupon he seized her in
his arms and ran with her down to the piers, jumped
on board of his ship, and set sail. The queen, as
soon as she heard the noise, rushed into the street,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and reached the pier just as the ship was gliding
from its moorings. Beside herself with wrath, she
screamed after the Birchlegs: "Would that I may
live to see the day when I shall cause you as great a
sorrow as you to-day have caused me."</p>

<p>Much more that she cried they did not hear, for
her voice came more faintly to them through the
wind, as the distance increased. From that day she
hated the king, though it is by no means clear that
he approved of Peter Steyper's violence. Finding
her position in Sweden less agreeable than she had
expected, she was soon induced to return to Norway,
where she became a centre of mischievous intrigue.
Among her partisans was the king's cousin,
Haakon Galen, a son of Sigurd Mouth's daughter
Cecilia and Folkvid the Lawman, a brave and reckless
youth who was deeply in love with the queen's
niece, Mistress Christina.<a name="FNanchor_A_63" id="FNanchor_A_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_63" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Over him the two women,
both of whom were arch-plotters, had considerable
influence, and the desire rose in them to put him on
the throne in his cousin's place. King Haakon, who,
if he had suspected his stepmother's design, would
have been on his guard, furnished her now with the
opportunity for accomplishing her evil purpose. He
invited her and her daughter to his Yule-tide feast,
offering her the high-seat at his own side. So far
from being conciliated by this offer, the queen burst
forth vehemently: "Long shall I remember how I
sat in the high-seat with my lord, King Sverre, on
Christmas Eve. Bring my greeting to King Haakon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>and tell him that I shall not share his high-seat
to-night."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_63" id="Footnote_A_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_63"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Not the same as the Princess Christina, Sverre's and Margaret's
daughter.</p></div>

<p>The king was aggrieved at this rebuff, and sent a
second message, begging her at least to allow his
sister Christina to grace his feast by her presence.
The messenger added that the king was very wroth.</p>

<p>"Does he suppose," cried Margaret, "that I do
not remember how he caused my daughter to be
torn away from me at Oslo, without his reminding
me of it into the bargain?"</p>

<p>To everybody's surprise, however, she began to
dress for the feast, and soon both mother and daughter
entered the banqueting hall, where they were
received with much honor.</p>

<p>The feast was a merry one and good cheer reigned
in the hall. Toward the evening of the day after
Christmas, however, the king began to feel indisposed,
and grew worse as the night advanced. He had
himself bled, but the illness made rapid progress,
until he lost consciousness. His body turned blue
and swelled up terribly. On New Year's Day, 1204,
he died. It was evident that he had been poisoned,
and the rumor soon got abroad that it was the queen
who had killed him. Although Haakon Galen did
his best to lead suspicion away from her, a general
clamor arose that she should prove her innocence by
carrying glowing irons. This the queen refused to
do, and in consideration of her rank obtained permission
to appoint a substitute who should submit
to the ordeal in her place. This substitute, however,
though he betrayed no fear of the result, was found
to have been badly burned, and the belief now be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>came
general that the queen was guilty. The excitement
against her was so great that Haakon Galen
was obliged to conduct her secretly away from Nidaros,
and to hide her in the house of one of his kinsmen
in the country. Later she made her escape to
Sweden, where she probably passed the rest of her
days on her estates. Both the Princess Christina and
her cousin Christina remained in Norway, the latter
as Haakon Galen's mistress.</p>

<p>The death of Haakon Sverresson plunged the
country in deep grief, not only because he was personally
beloved, but because it was supposed that
he left no issue.</p>

<p>The opportunity was now at hand for a new crop
of pretenders to fight for the crown and spread once
more anarchy and desolation over the land.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>GUTTORM SIGURDSSON (1204), AND INGE BAARDSSON
(1204-1217).</h3>


<p>The legitimate heir to the throne after Haakon's
death was his nephew, Guttorm Sigurdsson, a son
of his brother, Sigurd Lavard. In spite of his tender
age, the Birchlegs made haste to elect him, with the
understanding that Haakon Galen, with the title of
earl, should conduct the government. There were,
however, some of the Birchlegs who were dissatisfied
with this arrangement, partly because they were
jealous of Haakon Galen, partly because they felt
that, in such troublous times, a king was needed,
who should be something more than a name or a
figure-head. The Baglers, too, strange to say, were
ill at ease, because they feared that, Haakon Sverresson's
restraining influence being removed, the
Birchleg chiefs would give free rein to their passions
of avarice and vengeance. Half in self-defence they,
therefore, reorganized their troop under the leadership
of an impostor, calling himself Erling Stonewall
(Steinvegg), who pretended to be a son of King
Magnus Erlingsson. A pretender of this name had,
during the reign of Sverre, made some little stir, and
had been imprisoned by King Knut of Sweden in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
tower, whence he had escaped by means of a rope,
made out of his bed-clothes. The rope proved, however,
to be too short, and in letting himself drop to
the ground, Erling broke his hip. He was overtaken,
on his flight, by Sverre's men and in all probability
slain. Nevertheless, it required audacity rather than
proof of royal birth, in those days, to figure as
a pretender; and the second Erling Stonewall,
though probably few at first believed in him, soon
had a considerable following. It was of no use that
Bishop Nicholas opposed him, and urged his own
nephew, Philip, a grandson of Harold Gille's queen,
Ingerid, for the chieftainship. When Erling demanded
the right to prove his birth by the ordeal of
fire, the bishop told him bluntly that the result was
in his hands. Under such circumstances, the pretender
found it more to his advantage to make terms
with the bishop and receive his assurance that the
ordeal should turn out successfully. Erling, on his
side, promised, when he became king, to make Philip
his earl, and in other respects satisfied the prelate's
demands. The latter had, in the meanwhile, by conferences
with his peasants, ascertained that Philip's
candidacy was regarded with great disfavor, because
he neither had nor pretended to have a drop of royal
blood. The peasants utterly refused to recognize
him, and threatened to rebel, in case he was elected.
It was therefore to the bishop's advantage to keep
faith with Erling. The ordeal accordingly took
place with great solemnity in the presence of the
Danish king, Valdemar the Victorious, and proved
successful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Erling was then proclaimed king, and received as
a present from Valdemar a fleet of thirty fine ships.
In return he recognized him as his feudal overlord
and gave him hostages. The party of the magnates
was thus faithful to its traditions, in sacrificing patriotism
to private interests. With the aid of the
powerful Danish king the party had, indeed, a good
prospect of crushing the disheartened and disunited
Birchlegs, who just at that time received a fresh
blow in the death of their newly elected king.
Christina, Haakon Galen's mistress, could not allow
so slight an obstacle, as the life of a child, to stand
between her and the goal of her wishes. If Guttorm
were dead, her lover would have the best
chance of succeeding him, being on his mother's side
a grandson of Sigurd Mouth. It was, therefore, no
mere accident that Guttorm died; and with all the
symptoms of poisoning. He said that the "Swedish
woman" had taken him upon her lap and stroked
him caressingly over his whole body. Soon after he
felt, as if needles were piercing his flesh, and before
long he expired in great agony. Though Christina's
guilt was obvious, her lover had yet sufficient influence
to have the matter hushed up; and in order
to give her the full benefit of his protection, he
married her soon after. A meeting was now called
in Nidaros to elect a new king. Earl Haakon, who
was a favorite with the army, seemed to have every
chance in his favor; and he would probably have
been the choice of the Birchlegs, if Archbishop Erik
had not opposed him, on account of his relation to
Christina. The guilt thus defeated its own object.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
Several candidates were discussed, some of whom
were related to Sverre only on his mother's side and
thus had no consanguinity with the royal house.
The most prominent among these was Peter Steyper,
who had the additional advantage of having married
a daughter of King Magnus Erlingsson. After long
deliberations, the chiefs finally decided to leave the
choice to the peasants, who would then be sure to
stand by the king whom they themselves elected.
The peasants were according summoned to Oere-<i>thing</i>
where they conferred the royal dignity upon
Inge Baardsson, a younger half-brother of Haakon
Galen and like him, on the maternal side, a grandson
of Sigurd Mouth. No sooner did the Baglers hear
that the Birchlegs had chosen a new king than they
started northward from Tunsberg, in order to test
his mettle. The caution of Bishop Nicholas prevailed,
however, over the counsel of the more warlike
chiefs, and after some unimportant fights in and
about Bergen, the rebels betook themselves to Denmark,
where they had always a safe place of refuge.
King Inge and Earl Haakon, therefore, found no opposition,
when they visited Viken, and the peasants,
though the great majority of them sympathized with
the Baglers, had no scruple in swearing them allegiance.
In fact, the long war was having a demoralizing
influence upon the people, and its barbarizing
effects began to be visible in many ways. To save
their lives, the yeomen were obliged to feign friendship
for every pretender who came along with his
band, and swear him fidelity, or fly to the woods,
leaving their farms a prey to the marauders. Even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the ties of blood which had been exceptionally
strong among the Norsemen, began to be disregarded,
as members of the same family were impelled,
by diverging interests, to join different parties.
It was no rare occurence that brother fought against
brother, and father against son. Thus it is told of a
Bagler that during the attack upon Nidaros in 1206,
he was hotly pursuing a Birchleg whom he finally
killed. As he stooped over the dying man, in order
to deprive him of his arms and garments, he discovered
that it was his own brother. A great laxity in
all moral obligations resulted from this state of
things. Kings and chieftains broke their words;
enemies who had surrendered on promise of pardon
were ruthlessly slain; murder and rapine filled the
land.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was no great privilege
for the young and inexperienced Inge to wear
a crown which merely put a price upon his head. In
the spring of 1206, while he was in Nidaros celebrating
the wedding of his sister, the Baglers surprised
him in the night and slew a large number of his men.
The king himself escaped by pure chance, threw
himself into the river, and swam, half-clad, in the icy
water, out to a ship, and clung for a while to the
anchor cable. More dead than alive he reached the
shore, and would probably have perished from exposure,
if the Birchleg, Reidulf, who was also fleeing,
had not found him, wrapped him in his cloak, and
carried him on his back to a place of safety. Yet
Inge never overcame the effects of this terrible
night. He grew morose and despondent, and never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
regained his former light-heartedness. It was not
merely that he felt discredited as a chieftain by the
disgrace of having been surprised by his enemies in
a drunken sleep, in the house of his mistress; his
health, too, had suffered a shock from which it was
slow to recover.</p>

<p>On their return from Nidaros, the Baglers paid a
visit to Bergen, where they expected to starve the
Birchleg garrison in the block-house into surrender.
But here they reckoned without their host. Earl
Haakon, though he had not been present at the assault
upon his brother in Nidaros, felt impelled to
avenge it. He therefore sailed southward with a
small fleet and about seven hundred men, overtook
the rebels in Bergen and inflicted upon them a severe
defeat. Thus blindly pursuing partisan advantage,
Baglers and Birchlegs kept killing each other, forgetting
that they were all Norsemen, who would, in
the end, suffer by the devastation and exhaustion of
their common country. Year after year they continued
surprising each other in Nidaros, Bergen,
Tunsberg, and Oslo, burning each other's ships, and
robbing each other's treasures; but they appeared to
avoid a decisive battle which would have given an
overwhelming advantage to one party or the other,
thereby securing peace to the land. The death of
Erling Stonewall in 1207 enabled Bishop Nicholas to
carry out his desire to make his nephew, Philip Simonsson,
king of the Baglers. But Philip made no change
in the policy of his predecessor, persevering in the
same aimless marauding, which could scarcely be
dignified by the name of war. The parties were, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>deed,
so evenly matched, that it seemed hopeless for
the one to destroy the other, for which reason the
political stake in the struggle was almost lost sight
of, while immediate profit yet furnished a motive
for continuing in arms.</p>

<p>It was while anarchy was thus rioting and despondency
reigning throughout the land, that a hope suddenly
sprang up, like a star out of the depth of night.
It was well known that King Haakon Sverresson,
during his visit to Sarpsborg in 1203, had become
enamoured of the beautiful Inga of Varteig, and it
had also been whispered that she had reciprocated
his love. Soon after Haakon's death, she had borne
a son, and though it was taken for granted that the
king was his father, the matter had been hushed up,
lest the Baglers, who were masters in Viken, should
hear that an heir had been born to the throne. The
priest, Thrond, in whose house Inga gave birth to the
boy, baptized him and gave him the name Haakon,
after his father; but advised the utmost secrecy, and
let no one but his immediate family know of the
child's existence. Such a secret is, however, hard to
keep, and, after a while, the priest took Erlend of
Huseby, a man of good repute and a friend of
Sverre's house, into his confidence. Erlend rejoiced
that King Sverre's race was not extinct; but found
the boy's position, in the midst of the enemies' land,
perilous. He therefore persuaded Thrond to send
him and his mother to King Inge, and himself offered
to take them across the mountains. The boy Haakon
was then (December, 1205,) about a year and a half
old. There must have been some imminent danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
at hand which impelled the priest, after having waited
so long, to choose the most inclement season of the
year for the journey across the trackless, snow-covered
wilderness. The two friends started northward
with their precious charge and arrived, after infinite
hardships, in Nidaros, where they were well received
by King Inge. The boy now, for a while, sojourned
with his mother at court and was kindly treated.
The old Birchlegs came often to see him and playfully
took him between them and pulled him by the
arms and legs in order to make him grow faster. For
they were impatient to serve, once more, a king of
the old royal race. Haakon Galen, too, took a great
fancy to his young kinsman, though his demonstrations
of love were, no doubt, looked upon with fear
by those who had the boy's welfare at heart. Nevertheless,
it appears that the earl was actually sincere,
and felt moved, perhaps, by the very helplessness of
the boy to protect him. A kind Providence seemed
to be watching over him; for though living in the
midst of the intrigues and plottings of rival chiefs,
all of whom must have seen in him their most dangerous
rival, his life was preserved, and he escaped
unharmed from many dangers. Even the Baglers
refrained from killing him, when in 1206 he fell into
their hands, at the surrender of the block-house in
Bergen. It is perhaps not safe to assume that a half-latent
consciousness asserted itself, that in this boy
Norway's future was bound up; that upon him depended
the country's deliverance from the scourge
of civil war. More likely it is that his beauty and
winning ways appealed to friends and foes alike,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
while on the other hand, the love of the Birchlegs
was his best guard, because it convinced his ill-wishers
that disaster would swiftly overwhelm any
one who should venture to harm him.</p>

<p>Of the many small victories and defeats, sieges and
surrenders, flights and pursuits, which filled the years
1206 and 1207, without according any decisive advantage
to either party, it is not necessary to speak
at length. They were a series of barren futilities,
resulting in loss of life, and waste of the resources of
the land, without lastingly benefiting any one. Under
these circumstances, it is not strange that both
Birchlegs and Baglers began to long for a reconciliation.
Even to so bitter a partisan as Bishop Nicholas,
it became evident that a continuance of the war
would mean mutual destruction, and that the prize
of victory would be a devastated land and a barbarized
people. King Inge, too, was heartily tired of
the aimless hostilities, and even his pugnacious
brother, Haakon Galen, was not disinclined to listen
to proposals of peace. The new archbishop, Thore,
acted as mediator between the parties and used his
influence and his eloquence to extort from both the
necessary concessions. At last, when the conditions
were well understood on both sides, a meeting of the
Birchleg and Bagler chiefs was held at Hvitings&ouml;e
(1208), at which Philip Simonsson, the king of the
Baglers, swore allegiance to Inge, and became his
earl. In return he received Viken and the Oplands
in fief, and was wedded to Sverre's daughter, Christina.</p>

<p>The restoration of peace was not hailed as an un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>mixed
boon by many of those who had lost their
property by the war, and could only hope to enrich
themselves by the same means. Others had carried
arms so long, as to have lost all inclination for peaceful
industry. A great number of these, irrespective
of parties, started on an old-fashioned Viking expedition
to the Orkneys, Hebrides, and Man, ravaged and
plundered, and compelled the earls of those isles, once
more, to acknowledge the supremacy of the crown
of Norway. In spite of this service which they had
done to the king, they were severely censured on
their return, and forced by the bishops to surrender
their booty to the Church.</p>

<p>The last years of King Inge's reign were embittered
by his strained relation to Earl Haakon. The
latter, feeling his superiority to Inge in all the qualities
that grace a king, could not reconcile himself
to his subordinate position. He began intriguing
behind his brother's back, and privately sounded the
sentiments of the prominent peasants and chiefs, in
regard to his pretensions. From many he received
a favorable answer, and the plot was in a fair way to
succeed, when it was unexpectedly discovered by the
king. Inge, who had had perfect confidence in his
older brother, was more shocked than angered by
the proof of his treachery. He summoned all his
men to a house-<i>thing</i> and called upon them to stand
by him, declaring that he would tolerate no other
king in the land, as long as he was alive. This
speech won general approval and compelled Haakon
henceforth to weave his plots with greater secrecy.
Whether he was the instigator of the attempt upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
the king's life, which was made a year later, is not
known, but that either he or his wife Christina was
in some way implicated in it, is evident from the
king's unwillingness to have the would-be assassin
tried or punished. When his brother, Skule Baardsson,
urged him to make an example of the wretch, he
promised to have the matter investigated, to exile the
criminal, etc., but as nothing was done, Skule lost his
patience and killed him on his own responsibility.</p>

<p>It was, on the whole, a laudable spirit on Inge's
part which impelled him to avoid an open rupture
with Earl Haakon, even at the cost of personal sacrifice.
He knew the horrors of civil war and would
not take the responsibility of precipitating a breach
of the peace, as long as it was in his power to prevent
it. The fact that his health was poor, and that
there was a chance that Haakon might succeed him,
may also have disinclined him to discredit the latter
in the eyes of the people. Among Haakon's partisans
was Archbishop Thore, to whose intervention it was
chiefly due that the king and the earl in 1212 made
a compact, in accordance with which illegitimate
children were to be excluded from the succession,
and the one of the brothers who survived the other
should inherit the throne. This agreement, which
was proclaimed at Oere-<i>thing</i>, and sanctioned by the
bishops and the magnates of the land, was chiefly
aimed against the young prince, Haakon Haakonsson,
who, though a direct descendant in the male
line of the old royal house, was of illegitimate birth.
It excluded also, for the same reason, Inge's son
Guttorm, and transferred the succession to Haakon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Galen and his legitimate son, Knut. But in making
this compact, they underestimated the strength of the
sentiment which bound Sverre's veterans to the boy
Haakon. One of them, Helge Hvasse, who was in
the habit of going frequently to see the prince, and
playing with him, grew very wroth when he heard
of the agreement. When Haakon ran up to him to
have his usual romp, he pushed him roughly away
and bade him begone. The boy, unaccustomed to
such treatment, looked reproachfully at him, and
asked why he was angry.</p>

<p>"Begone," cried Helge; "to-day thy paternal heritage
was taken from thee, and I don't care for thee
any more."</p>

<p>"Where was that done, and who did it?" asked
Haakon.</p>

<p>"It was done at Oere-<i>thing</i>, and they who did it
were the two brothers, King Inge and Earl Haakon."</p>

<p>"Do not be angry with me, mine own Helge,"
said the boy; "and be not troubled about this; their
judgment cannot be valid, as my guardian was not
present to answer in my behalf."</p>

<p>"Who, then, is thy guardian?" inquired Helge.</p>

<p>"My guardians are God, and the Holy Virgin, and
St. Olaf," exclaimed Haakon solemnly; "into their
keeping I have given my cause, and they will guard
my interests, both in the division of the country and
in all my welfare."</p>

<p>Much moved, the veteran seized the boy in his
arms and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Thanks for those words, my prince," he said;
"such words are better spoken than unspoken."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">HAAKON HAAKONSSON AND HELGE HVASSE.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>When this occurrence was reported to Christina,
she scolded Haakon, and henceforth treated him
harshly. But she dared not show her evil disposition
toward him in the presence of her husband. For
the earl, though he had no scruples in barring the
boy's way to the throne, was yet attached to him,
and would not allow him to come to harm. Haakon's
remarkable precocity amused him, as it did all his
men. Several anecdotes are preserved of his droll
sayings and doings. Thus, when once the weather
was so cold that the bread could not be buttered,
the little prince took a piece of bread and bent it
around the butter, saying: "Let us tie the butter to
the bread, Birchlegs."</p>

<p>This saying became a proverb in the camp of the
Birchlegs.</p>

<p>The king's indulgence to his brother in the matter
of the succession had not quieted but rather stimulated
the latter's ambition. By incessant intriguing
he succeeded in fomenting a peasant's rebellion in
Tr&ouml;ndelag which was, however, quelled without
serious loss of life. Soon after this exploit, he was
taken ill and died in Bergen 1214, aged thirty-eight
years. His wife, who knew that the Birchlegs had
a long score to settle with her, made haste to quit
the country with her son. Haakon Haakonsson, who
had been fostered in the earl's house, was now transferred
to the court, where he was treated as became
his rank. There the Birchlegs flocked again about
him, watching jealously every one who approached
him. They were in many ways discontented with
King Inge, whom they held to be an aristocrat, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
by his poor health and peaceful disposition unfitted
for the chieftainship. Besides, his brother Skule was
openly intriguing to push Haakon aside and place
himself in the line of succession. The disaffection
then became so great that a number of Birchlegs
under the leadership of Andres Skjaldarband endeavored
to persuade Haakon to place himself at the
head of a rebellion. But Haakon refused to give ear
to such counsel.</p>

<p>As the king's health declined and he perceived that
his death was approaching, he loved to have the boy
about him and to listen to his droll and vivacious
talk. All public business passed, during this time,
through the hands of Skule Baardsson, whom Inge
made his earl, and the guardian of his son. The king
died in April, 1217, being but thirty years old.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>HAAKON HAAKONSSON THE OLD (1217-1263).</h3>


<p>The first act of the Birchlegs, after the death of
King Inge, was to give Haakon a body-guard, which
was to follow him night and day. Earl Skule, on
his side, opened a campaign of intriguing and chicanery,
in which he was faithfully supported by the new
archbishop, Guttorm, and the canons of the cathedral
chapter in Nidaros. In spite of all their underhand
measures, however, Haakon was proclaimed
king at Oere-<i>thing</i> by the Birchlegs, and Skule, who
did not feel himself strong enough to defy the general
sentiment, had to acquiesce in what he could not
prevent. It was of no avail that the canons of the
chapter locked up the shrine of St. Olaf upon which
the king was to swear to keep the laws; the Birchlegs
determined to dispense with the shrine rather than to
dispense with their king. Nor did the negotiations
of the earl with Philip, the so-called king of the Baglers,
lead to anything; for Philip died shortly after
King Inge, leaving no children; and Haakon sailed
southward with a large fleet and took possession of
Viken and the Oplands, which since the treaty of
Hvitings&ouml;e in 1208 had been under the dominion
of the Baglers. By a wise policy of conciliation he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
induced the chiefs of the rebels to acknowledge his
overlordship, on condition of their being permitted
to keep one half of the fiefs which had been granted
to Philip. The following year, they also consented
to give up their old party name, which recalled the
times of civil dissension and strife, and to fight side
by side with the Birchlegs, against a new band of
rebels, called the Slittungs (Ragamuffins), which had
been organized under the leadership of a priest,
named Benedikt or Bene Skindkniv (Skin-knife).
This arrant impostor professed, like so many of his
predecessors, to be the son of King Magnus Erlingsson,
and in spite of the utter improbability of his
story, upwards of a thousand men soon gathered
about him and began robbing and plundering. It was
merely to furnish an excuse for a breach of the peace
that they professed belief in Bene's pretensions.
Robbers, footpads, and all sorts of nomadic vagabonds
could, in those days, give themselves a semblance
of respectability by providing themselves with
a candidate for the throne. A great many credulous
people could then be induced to join them and their
depredations were called war instead of robbery.</p>

<p>A war, and especially a civil war, always drags in
its wake a long train of disastrous consequences.
The longer it lasts, the more difficult is the return to
peace. The miserable internecine strife which had
lasted, with brief interruptions, since Harold Gille's
ascension of the throne (1130), had weaned a whole
generation from the pursuits of peace, accustoming
it to scenes of bloodshed and violence. It had
added to the natural risks of industrial occupations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and made rebellion, as it were, a legitimate profession.
The thousands of homeless vagabonds who
infest every imperfectly organized society, and the
numerous class who, by nature, are criminally inclined,
will always seize such an opportunity to support
themselves, at the expense of society, and will far
rather endure the dangers and hardships of a perpetual
war than the wearing routine and sustained
activities of peace. The material was therefore at
hand for continued rebellion, and as long as the
supply of pretenders showed no signs of giving out,
there was every prospect that the king would have
his hands full. Only the gradual destruction of the
turbulent and the greater chances of the survival of
the friends of order would, in the end, decide the
struggle in favor of the latter. The problem is, however,
more complicated than it appears to be, for the
gradual destruction of the turbulent came, in the
course of time, to mean the destruction of the warlike
spirit itself. And a century after peace had
been concluded, a period of decline set in, which
continued for four hundred years.</p>

<p>A greater danger than the rebellion of the Slittungs
was, however, threatening King Haakon from
one who called himself his friend. The r&ocirc;le of intriguer
and mischief-maker, which during King Inge's
reign had been filled by Haakon Galen, appeared to
have devolved with his other dignities upon his
brother, Earl Skule. To see royal honor bestowed
upon a fourteen-year-old boy, who had done nothing
to merit it, galled his proud soul. Like Haakon
Galen, he had long stood so near to the throne, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
he could not comprehend, why it should always remain
beyond his reach. After the brief campaign
against the Slittungs, he began again his machinations,
aided as usual by the archbishop and the clergy,
who seemed yet to cherish their ancient grudge
against Sverre's house. When Haakon arrived in
Nidaros, two weeks before Easter (1218), the archbishop
treated him with studious discourtesy, while
he did every thing in his power to distinguish the
earl. When the king on Palm Sunday went up to
place his offering upon the altar, the prelate did not
even turn toward him, or in any way appear to be
conscious of his presence. When taken to task for
his incivility, he replied boldly that he was acting
deliberately on the advice of all the bishops and
many chieftains, who, like himself, had doubts as to
whether the king was the son of Haakon Sverresson.
Haakon, young as he was, saw at once the plot that
was here concealed. But so great was his confidence
in the justice of his cause, that he consented to have
his mother bear glowing irons, to prove his origin.
Inga had before offered to submit to this ordeal, but
had been prevented by the archbishop, who for some
reason did not then desire to pronounce upon her
son's claim, possibly because he had not yet arranged
his terms with Skule. It was of course unheard of,
that a king, actually in possession of the realm, should
be put to the humiliation of proving who he was;
and his friend Dagfinn Peasant expressed the general
sentiment when he said: "It will be hard to show
another instance of such a case; that the sons of
peasants and cottagers have ventured to prescribe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
such humiliating terms to an absolute king. * * *
I think it were just as well to bear another kind of
iron, viz., cold steel, against the king's foes, and then
let God judge between them."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus431.jpg" width="364" height="500" alt="WEST FRONT OF DRONTHEIM CATHEDRAL." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">WEST FRONT OF DRONTHEIM CATHEDRAL.</span>
</div>

<p>As Earl Skule's plot seemed now in a fair way to
succeed, he became suddenly affable and affectionate
toward the king. He felt positive that his clerical
friends would manage to have the ordeal result in
accordance with his wishes. Nevertheless, to make
assurance doubly sure, he bribed a foreigner in his
service, named Sigar of Brabant, to approach the
king's mother, and offer her an herb which, he asserted,
had the power to heal burns; but a guard of
devoted Birchlegs, among whom was Dagfinn Peasant,
surrounded the church in which she was fasting,
preparatory to the ordeal, and the earl's emissary
was, therefore, compelled to confide his errand to
the latter. Dagfinn replied: "No art or healing
will we employ here, except such as Christ in his
mercy will grant. Begone with thy twaddle, or disaster
will overtake thee, if thou darest again utter
such speech."</p>

<p>Inga was then warned of the plot and told to be
on her guard. For if it could be proved that she
had used healing herbs, the test would be invalid, and
opprobrium would have overwhelmed both her and
her son. All the machinations of her enemies, however,
came to naught; she endured the ordeal triumphantly.
It is difficult to explain how this result came
about, for the odds were certainly against her. The
earl had, perhaps, from over-confidence, neglected
some link in his long chain of precautions. However<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
that may be, he had, after this severe check, to start
all over again&mdash;to spin, with painstaking care, a fresh
web of intrigue, in order slowly to undermine the
king's power. His plan seems to have been to
alienate Haakon's trustiest friends from him, or to
get them removed to such a distance that they could
no longer be of any help to him; then to set them
by the ears mutually, so that one slew the other and
the king punished the survivor. But ingenious as
this plot was, it was not entirely successful. The
king's forgiving disposition, and a suspicion, on his
part, that the earl was really at the bottom of these
mysterious enmities and slayings, impelled him to act
contrary to the latter's expectation. It was obvious
to all that he bought the earl's pretended friendship
at too high a price, and many of his men would have
preferred open warfare to this suppressed suspicion
and hypocritical good-will. There was, indeed, ample
opportunity for strife between the two parties, and
quarrels and bloody fights between the "earl's-men"
and the "king's-men" were of frequent
occurrence. All the conditions for another civil war
were, in fact, at hand, and it was only the disinclination
of the king to let loose, once more, the dogs
of war, which preserved even the semblance of
peace. The fact that the king was under the guardianship
of a man who spent his time in plotting
against them, seemed to the Birchleg chiefs to call
for precautions, on their part; and the idea occurred
to them to convert Skule's hostility into friendship,
by identifying his interests with those of the
king. For this purpose they proposed a marriage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
between Haakon and the earl's ten-year-old daughter,
Margaret. The king, though he was not eager
for such a marriage, yielded to the representations
of his counsellors, and Skule, after some hesitation,
consented to have the betrothal take place (1219).
The actual marriage was preliminarily postponed, on
account of the tender age of the bride. But those
who had supposed that Skule could be made to abandon
his scheming, because the king was his son-in-law,
had made a miscalculation. Circumstances,
however, compelled him, soon after the betrothal,
to fight in defence of the crown, against a new band
of rebels, called the Ribbungs, who had absorbed
their predecessors, the Slittungs, and added largely
to their number. This band owed its origin to the
former Bagler chief, Gudolf of Blakkestad, who had
been appointed a prefect by Haakon, but had later
been deprived of his office, on account of his unpopularity
with the peasants. To avenge himself,
he raised the banner of rebellion, and provided himself
with a candidate for the throne in the person of
Sigurd, an alleged son of the Bagler king, Erling
Stonewall. All those who had a real or an imagined
cause for discontent, and many who were merely
intent upon plunder, now rushed together under the
standard of the Ribbungs. These made considerable
progress in Viken, defeated and chased away the
royal prefects, and gained much booty. They were
secretly supported by that hoary mischief-maker,
Bishop Nicholas, who, in spite of his professions of
friendship, yet remained consistent in his hatred of
Sverre's race. The earl, too, who was sent to de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>stroy
the rebels, was less energetic than he might
have been, giving himself an appearance of zeal in
his master's behalf, but being really disinclined to
strike an effective blow. It was, rather, in his interest
to keep them in the field, for the purpose of
injuring the king and preventing him from growing
too powerful. In the various fights which he had
with the Ribbungs in Viken (1221), he did, indeed,
inflict considerable injury upon them, and in the
battle of Svang, at Lake Mj&ouml;sen (1222), killed one
hundred and fifty of their number. But immediately
afterward he made peace with Sigurd Ribbung,
who had the impudence to demand one third
of the kingdom and the earl's daughter for his wife.
Skule replied that neither had he brought up his
daughter to live in the woods, nor was he minded to
give up any part of his fiefs. But if the king was inclined
to consider Sigurd's proposition, the earl
promised to use whatever influence he had with his
son-in-law in his behalf. On these conditions the
rebel chief dismissed his band, and, on the promise
of safe-conduct, betook himself to the earl's camp
where he was treated with great distinction. The
moment for pushing his claim was, however, not a
favorable one, as the relation between the king and
the earl, at this time, took a sudden turn for the
worse. It appeared that Skule had levied troops
and contributions, outside of his own fief, accordingly
in the king's domain, and Haakon was so
incensed at this fresh infringement of his rights that
he wrote him a letter, in which he threatened him
with war, in case he persevered in disregarding their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>agreement. The earl replied to this letter by immediately
setting sail for Denmark. He had evidently
taken a great resolution. What this resolution
was is easy to guess.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus437.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="OLD NORSE CAPITALS." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">OLD NORSE CAPITALS.</span>
</div>

<p>The kings of Denmark had, since the days of Harold
Bluetooth, claimed overlordship over Viken, and they
had repeatedly fomented rebellion in Norway for
the purpose of regaining the lost province. Skule's
intention was now to thrust Haakon from the throne
by the aid of Valdemar the Victorious, and to
take the entire country in fief from him. But to his
unutterable astonishment, when he arrived in Denmark,
Valdemar was nowhere to be found. He had
been captured, five days before, by Count Henrik
of Schwerin, and was now languishing with his son
in a prison in Mecklenburg. Bitterly disappointed,
Skule returned home, and was compelled to resume
his mask of benevolent interest in his son-in-law's
affairs. The latter had just filled his eighteenth
year, which, in the case of princes, was regarded as
the age of majority. He needed, therefore, no longer
a guardian, and custom seemed to demand some
ceremony on his formal assumption of the government.
An assembly of notables was therefore summoned
to meet in Bergen (1223), where Archbishop
Guttorm, who, in the meanwhile, by concessions, had
been bribed to take the king's side, solemnly reaffirmed
his right to the throne. Sigurd Ribbung's
claim was pronounced invalid, as was also that of
Squire Knut, the son of Haakon Galen and Christina,
who had sent representatives to the meeting. Earl
Skule saw from the beginning that the sentiment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
the assembly was so overwhelmingly in Haakon's
favor, that it would be of no use for him to urge his
pretensions. He therefore contented himself with
extorting as favorable terms for himself as possible
at the renewal of his compact with the king. After
many negotiations he exchanged his southern fief for
the northern third of the country, extending from the
North Cape to the southern boundary at S&ouml;ndm&ouml;re.
But he still remained, in name at least, a royal vassal,
and was compelled to swear allegiance to the king;
although he enjoyed all the royal revenues from his
fiefs, and paid no tax or tribute to any one.</p>

<p>In accordance with this agreement Haakon now
moved southward and took up his residence in Oslo.
This city, which had recently been burned down, he
rebuilt with great care, and came thereby into frequent
contact with the ancient enemy of his race,
Bishop Nicholas. This venerable scoundrel succeeded
actually in gaining his confidence for a
time, and obtained during this brief friendship substantial
advantages for himself and his see. Haakon
always took pleasure in showing his zeal for religion
by liberality toward the Church, and the wily bishop
was the man to take advantage of such a disposition.
He persuaded him on the death of Archbishop
Guttorm (1223) to give the weight of his recommendation
to his enemy, Peter of Husastad, who, in
accordance with the advice of Nicholas, feigned
friendship, until he had got the mitre securely on
his head.</p>

<p>It was not in accordance with the earl's plans to
let the king sit quietly in Viken, increasing his popu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>larity
and power. He was therefore scarcely grieved,
when he heard of Sigurd Ribbung's flight; nay, it is
even probable, that he gave the rebel chief the opportunity
to escape, if he did not actually persuade him
to renew the rebellion. The Ribbungs, who were not
loath to resume their former activity, gathered again
in large numbers about their leader, and began plundering
and killing the king's adherents as of old.
Whenever they were pursued, they made their escape
across the frontier into the Swedish province,
Vermeland, only to return as soon as their pursuers
had turned their backs on them. King Haakon
wrote repeatedly to the Swedish king, or rather to
his guardians, as he was himself a child, complaining
of the protection which Sweden afforded his enemies.
Prominent among the counsellors of King Erik
was then Eskil Lawman, who had married Christina,
the widow of Haakon Galen. This unscrupulous
woman, who had hated Haakon from his
childhood, now exerted her influence against him at
the Swedish court; the consequence was that the
counsellors disregarded his remonstrance, and continued
to give the Ribbungs an asylum. Their audacity
naturally grew, in proportion as they became
conscious of this protection; and Haakon was at last
compelled to invade Vermeland with an army of
2,400 men, in the middle of winter (1225). He burned
many farms, and ravaged several parishes, but had no
chance to fight any decisive battle, either with the
Ribbungs or the Swedes. The latter had fled to the
woods, and the former had availed themselves of the
king's visit to Sweden to make a foray into Vest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>fold,
and attack Tunsberg. The former Bagler chief,
Arnbj&ouml;rn Jonsson, who was close on their heels with
his troops, was detained in Oslo by Bishop Nicholas,
who by his double dealing succeeded in insuring the
escape of the rebels.</p>

<p>In April, 1225, the king, in the midst of his protracted
campaign against the Ribbungs, celebrated
his wedding in Bergen with his betrothed, Earl
Skule's daughter. The bride was then about
seventeen years old, the groom twenty. If it was
Skule's intention, when he gave his consent to the
marriage, to secure himself an ally at court, he was
disappointed. For Margaret, from the moment she
became queen, made common cause with her husband,
and in no wise favored her father's schemes.
She was a gentle and affectionate wife and a good
mother.</p>

<p>The Ribbungs in the meanwhile continued their
guerilla warfare, having taken possession of the
Helge&ouml;, an island in Lake Mj&ouml;sen, whence they
made forays into the fertile parishes that border
on the lake, and practically controlled the Oplands.
Earl Skule, who was again sent out to quell the rebellion,
dawdled as usual, nursing his secret treason
and being at heart more anxious to injure the king
than his enemies. In order to destroy the Ribbungs,
it was necessary to reach the island, and ostensibly
for this purpose he began to build ships on the
shores of the lake. He built them, however, deliberately
in such a fashion that they leaked, and could
scarcely be kept afloat. The Ribbungs, instead of
being frightened by his preparations, grew daily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
bolder, and sent messengers to the king in Oslo, proposing
to give him battle. Haakon accepted the
offer, and advanced with his army to the appointed
place of meeting (Eidsvold), while the earl, instead
of hastening to meet him, took the road across the
mountains to Nidaros, after having burned his worthless
ships. Here was the most incontrovertible
proof of treason; and there are also indications that
in a correspondence between Bishop Nicholas and
the Ribbungs which had fallen into the king's hands,
the earl was seriously compromised. Nevertheless,
Haakon chose to feign blindness rather than call the
traitor to account. Possibly he did not feel himself
strong enough to fight Skule and the Ribbungs at
the same time, preferring to get rid of one enemy
before engaging the other.</p>

<p>After having waited in vain for the Ribbungs at
Eidsvold, Haakon returned with his army to Oslo,
where he learned that Bishop Nicholas was lying
upon his death-bed. The old prelate, with whom
falsity and double-dealing had become a second
nature, seemed yet to feel some anxiety as to his
fate in the hereafter. He therefore summoned the
king to his bedside, made him a full confession (not,
however, until the king had shown him the evidence
of his treason), and implored his forgiveness, which
was readily granted. The bishop died in November,
1225, seventy-five years old, having spent his long
life in fomenting rebellion, and in ravaging and destroying
his native land. His great talents proved a
curse both to himself and his people. Not long after
his demise, Sigurd Ribbung died (1226), and Haakon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
Galen's son, Squire Knut, was induced by his guileful
mother to take his place. He brought with him a
large band of Swedes, thereby giving his warfare the
appearance of a foreign invasion, and arousing the
hostility of the peasantry of the Oplands, who had
formerly been friendly to the Ribbungs. In a fight
at Aker he was defeated by a united army of Birchlegs
and peasants, and during the following months
he suffered repeated disasters, and was deserted by
many of his best men. After a dastardly attempt to
capture the king by inviting him to a conference,
under promise of safety,&mdash;an attempt which failed
by the merest chance,&mdash;Squire Knut dismissed his
band (1227), submitted to Haakon, who not only
forgave him, but for his father's sake gave him fiefs,
and treated him with distinction. The young man,
as soon as he was removed from his mother's influence,
gave up all thought of rebellion, married, some
years later, a younger daughter of Earl Skule, and
became one of the king's most devoted friends.</p>

<span class="caption">ON THE SOGNE FJORD.</span>
</div>

<p>As the Ribbungs were now out of the way and
could no longer be made to serve his purposes, the
earl hatched a new plot which, on account of its ingenuity,
ran less risk of premature detection. He
professed a desire to take the cross, and began warlike
preparations on a grand scale. He obtained
from the Pope permission to exact one twentieth of
all the ecclesiastical revenues of the province of
Nidaros in aid of his enterprise, and satisfied his conscience
by endowing the Church, in return, with his
great family estate, Rein, which was converted into
a nunnery. Extreme caution was characteristic of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
Skule; and he meant, this time, to leave nothing to
chance. He began at once to build ships, and to
gather warriors about him from all parts of the country.
As the Danish king, Valdemar the Victorious,
had now regained his liberty, he could also count
upon his aid, and a formal agreement was made between
them in accordance with which Skule should
assist the king in recovering his lost provinces. In
return for this service Valdemar promised to put
Skule on the throne of Norway. That some such
agreement must have existed is obvious from the
fact that the earl actually set sail for Denmark (1227),
without asking Haakon's permission, but was met on
his way by the latter and informed of the disastrous
defeat of his ally at Bornh&ouml;ved. He then concluded
to await developments; as he would run too great a
risk in visiting Denmark, while Valdemar's enemies
had the upper hand. Putting on a bold face, he
joined his fleet to that of his son-in-law and returned
to Bergen. The king, although he did not deceive
himself as to Skule's purposes, kept his counsel and
feigned ignorance. Nay, he even carried his generosity
so far as to lend the traitor ships and provisions
when, the following year, (1228) he set out once more
to visit the king of Denmark. Since his defeat at
Bornh&ouml;ved, Valdemar was indeed much less formidable
than before his captivity, and the warlike spirit
had wellnigh left him. Haakon may therefore have
suspected that, surrounded as he was with enemies,
both on the south and the west, he would scarcely
care to add another on the north. Moreover, Haakon
had by this time secured the friendship of the Ger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>man
emperor, Frederick II., who was a bitter enemy
of Denmark, and he might, therefore, have a chance
to keep Valdemar in check, in case he should lend a
favorable ear to the earl's persuasions. Under these
circumstances he hardly exposed himself to any risk,
nay hoped, perhaps, by facilitating his father-in-law's
approach to the Danish king, to convince him of the
futility of all his plottings. If that was his intention,
he must have been disappointed in the result. For
when Skule returned he had added to his power for
mischief, by obtaining the northern half of the Danish
province of Halland in fief, thereby becoming the
vassal of a foreign prince, who, moreover, was the
enemy of his own king.</p>

<p>One would have supposed that he was now ready
for a decisive blow. But he hesitated again, and
seemed half inclined to retrace his steps. There was
always something lacking in the completeness of his
preparations, and another delay was always necessary.
He is, indeed, an interesting figure, this wily and ambitious
intriguer, who has the courage to plot treason,
nay takes pleasure in perfecting all the details of his
plot, but always pauses before taking the irretrievable
step. Like Schiller's Wallenstein, he fondles the
thought, plays with it, utters it cautiously and hypothetically,
but leaves himself always, as he supposes,
a path of retreat, until his own acts spin a web about
him and bar him the road back to safety. Year by
year he compromises himself more irretrievably; his
treasonable letters fall into the hands of the king, and
when, after twenty-two years of covert treason, he
drifts into open rebellion, it is because there is apparently
no other alternative left to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the king left no means untried
to keep the earl to his allegiance. In 1233 he summoned
him to an assembly of notables in Bergen
(<i>Rigsm&ouml;de</i>), at which the archbishop, the bishops,
and a great number of secular dignitaries were present.
The king here called his father-in-law formally
to account for his actions, and the liegemen rose, one
after the other, and cited proofs of the earl's disloyalty.
When the turn came to Skule to defend
himself, he began in this wise:</p>

<p>"I know a ditty: 'The eagle sat on a stone,' and I
also know another which runs like this: 'The eagle
sat on a stone,' and a lot more which all run the same
way. Thus it is here to-day. Every one talks in his
own way, but they all finish up with the same ditty,
viz.: to bring accusations against me."</p>

<p>He made a long and eloquent speech, and, as it is
said, defended himself with great adroitness. It is
doubtful, however, if anybody believed him, and it
was only the king's reluctance to resort to the sword,
which saved him, on this as on many previous occasions.
A new agreement was drawn up which was
no more effective in restraining the earl's treasonable
scheming than the previous ones had been. On the
contrary, he was no sooner left to his own devices
than he resumed his activity for the overthrow of
the king. His purpose this time was to involve
Haakon in a quarrel with the Church, in order afterward
to crush him with the formidable weapons
which the Church had at its command. He shrewdly
provided himself with a cat's paw in the person of
Bishop Paul of Hamar, who was his devoted adhe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>rent.
The archbishop, at this time, Sigurd Tavse,
was a partisan of the king, but zealous for the welfare
of the Church, and therefore, as Skule reasoned,
capable of being alienated by a controversy in which
the interests of the Church and those of the king
were in conflict. Bishop Paul accordingly produced
a document, alleged to have been issued by the Bagler
king, Inge, in 1226, in which the Helge&ouml; in Mj&ouml;sen,
which was the property of the crown, was presented
to the episcopal see of Hamar. The king naturally
contested the validity of this document, as Inge, a
rebel chief, had no right to give away the property
of the crown which had never been his. An appeal
was now made to the Pope, Gregory IX., and a campaign
of intrigue and mendacity was begun. The
excellent and honorable Haakon was systematically
reviled and slandered, until the Pope came to believe
that he was a villain of the deepest dye. Bishop
Paul, virtually as the ambassador of the earl, though
nominally in the interest of the Church, betook himself
to Rome, where he succeeded in prejudicing
Gregory IX. against all the king's adherents, and
even against his own superior, the archbishop.
Skule, on the other hand, was represented in the
most flattering light, as the munificent friend of the
Church, and its defender against the encroachments
of the unscrupulous king. The object was to procure
a ban-bull against Haakon.</p>

<p>The plot was spoiled, however, by being prematurely
revealed. An Icelander, named Sturla Sighvatsson,
a nephew and an active enemy of the
historian Snorre Sturlasson, met Bishop Paul in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Rome and started homeward in his company.
Whether he gained the confidence of his travelling
companion, or otherwise obtained an insight into his
intrigues at the Roman Curia, is not known. At all
events, he immediately sought the king, on his arrival
in Norway, and acquainted him with the doings of
his enemies. The king summoned the earl once
more to meet him in Bergen; but this time Skule's
courage failed him. Instead of going to Bergen, he
went with his army to Nidaros, and thence across the
mountains to the Oplands, which was the king's territory.
This was about equivalent to a declaration
of war, but as usual, he took only half measures,
hesitated, talked threateningly, but refrained from
actual hostilities. At the intercession of Archbishop
Sigurd, he was induced to promise to keep the peace
during the winter (1235-6) on condition of receiving
one third of the royal prefectures (<i>Sysler</i>) in the
Oplands and Viken. It seems to indicate weakness
on Haakon's part that he was willing to make such
concessions; and his readiness to yield had naturally
the effect of encouraging the earl's adherents and
making them screw their demands still higher.
During the following year (1237) a new agreement
was made, in accordance with which Skule was confirmed
in the possession of his territory in the south,
and was raised to the rank of duke&mdash;a rank which
had never before been conferred upon any man in
Norway. There was but one title, however, which
could satisfy Skule's ambition, and as long as Haakon
refused to grant that, he felt himself justified in continuing
his agitation. With increasing recklessness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
he defied the king's will, gathered great numbers of
warriors about him, built ships, and conducted himself
in every way as an independent ruler. It became
the fashion at his court to ridicule the king as a
cowardly busybody who only talked, but lacked the
heart to strike. The Varbelgs<a name="FNanchor_A_64" id="FNanchor_A_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_64" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;thus the partisans
of the duke were called&mdash;invented for him the nickname,
Haakon Sleepy. His reluctance to assume the
responsibility for civil war, they mistook for fear, and
his conscientiousness for pusillanimity.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_64" id="Footnote_A_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_64"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The same name had been borne by another band of rebels
which, under the boy Vikar, had fought against King Sverre.</p></div>

<p>When the spirit of rebellion which the duke had
bred in his surroundings had thrown away all restraint,
it began to react upon himself, spurring him on
to deed, and counteracting his natural indecision of
character. He was now nearly fifty years old, and if
he ever were to gain the crown, there was no time to
be lost. Accordingly he mustered courage in 1239
to summon the Tr&ouml;nders to Oere-<i>thing</i>, and to proclaim
himself king of all Norway. When the canons
of the cathedral refused to permit the shrine of St.
Olaf to be used for the ceremony, Skule's son, Peter,<a name="FNanchor_B_65" id="FNanchor_B_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_65" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
jumped up on the altar, pulled the coffin up, and had
it removed, by force, to the <i>thing</i>. In order that
Haakon should gain no intelligence of what had
taken place, all the roads which led out of the city
were guarded, but for all that, one man, named Grim
Keikan, managed to make his escape and to warn
the king of the threatening danger. It was in the
middle of the night that the king received this message,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>and he went instantly to the queen's rooms and
demanded admittance. The queen, aroused from
her sleep, asked anxiously what news he brought.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_65" id="Footnote_B_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_65"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Peter was an illegitimate child. His mother was the wife of
Andres Skjaldarband.</p></div>

<p>"Only this trifle," he said, "that there are now
two kings in Norway."</p>

<p>"Only one is the right king," she answered
gravely, "and that one are you."</p>

<p>It had been Skule's first plan to surprise Haakon
in Bergen, and capture him. But he soon learned
that the king had heard of his exploits, and was prepared
to receive him. He then sent out bands of
warriors to different parts of the country to kill the
royal prefects and all prominent friends of the king.
A great many excellent men, who were utterly unprepared
for hostilities, were thus foully murdered;
churches were violated, and many atrocities committed.
The duke, in the meanwhile, remained
quietly in Nidaros where he occupied himself in
writing letters to foreign princes and potentates, informing
them of the step he had taken, and endeavoring
to stir up difficulties for Haakon by unscrupulous
misrepresentations. When, however, he
learned that the king was coming with a large force
to attack him, he started (Feb., 1240) with six
hundred men across the mountains to the Oplands.
Here he was met by his son-in-law, Squire Knut,
who had been appointed earl in his place, and defeated
him and the able commander, Arnbj&ouml;rn
Jonsson, at Laaka. It was now high time for the
king to appear upon the scene, if he were to prevent
the rebellion from assuming such proportion, as to be
beyond his power to quell it. The danger suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
developed in him a decision and promptness of
action, which went far to raise the sinking courage
of his men. He declined the archbishop's offer to
open negotiations once more; arrived, after a voyage
of unprecedented rapidity, in Viken, and rowed,
under cover of a fog, up the Folden Fjord to Oslo.
In view of the possibility of his death, he had made
all preparations for the succession, but he was resolved
to sell his life dearly. The Varbelgs, who
had not the faintest suspicion that he was near, were
sleeping soundly after a night's carouse, when
suddenly the war-horn resounded, and the storm-bell
rang. The prows of the royal fleet were then seen
emerging from the fog and making for the piers.
The duke, as soon as the alarm was given, tumbled
out of bed and flung on his clothes. The dawn
was just reddening in the east, and the fog was lifting.
The ships were now at the piers, and the
troops were disembarking. The Varbelgs supposed,
at first, that it was Earl Knut, who had come to revenge
his defeat at Laaka. But they were soon undeceived.
When they caught sight of the royal
banner they knew that King Haakon was not far
away. Strangely enough, though they saw him
storming forward, every moment exposing himself
to danger, nay, even rushing on ahead of his men,
they were not eager to kill him. They feared that
the duke's cause was lost, and though they fought
bravely, they had no hope of victory. The duke
fled and was pursued by the Birchlegs; but they did
not succeed in overtaking him. Many men fell in
that fight, but many more sought refuge in the
churches and were pardoned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, indeed, the duke himself, as we have seen,
who was the originator as well as the leader of the
rebellion. He was not the expression and embodiment
of a disloyal feeling among the people, as many
previous pretenders had been, but the rebellion was
solely due to his own personal ambition. As long
as he was alive, therefore, the brands of civil war
might at any moment be rekindled. It was this reflection
which prompted the king, in this instance, to
smother all natural feeling for his father-in-law and
not to shrink from punishing him as he had deserved.
Seven days after the battle of Oslo he sent fifteen
well-manned ships to Nidaros, whither the duke had
fled, under the command of Aasulf of Austraat, a
resolute man and one of Skule's bitterest enemies.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Nidaros, Skule fled to the woods,
roaming about for two days and nights with a few
friends who would not desert him. At last the
friars of the monastery of Elgeseter took pity on
him, provided him and his followers with cowls, and
hid them in a tower. The tidings soon reached
Aasulf that some strange-looking monks had been
seen to enter the cloister, and he immediately set
out with his men and demanded their surrender.
When the friars refused, some of the Birchlegs set
fire to the monastery. Others endeavored to put
out the fire, but their efforts were futile. The smoke
and the heat now compelled the duke and his companions
to descend from the tower. As he stepped
out of the gate he held his shield above his head,
saying: "Hew me not in the face; for it is not meet
thus to treat chieftains."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Instantly the Birchlegs fell upon him and slew
him (1240).</p>

<p>The death of Skule ended the rebellion. There
was now no man in Norway who was strong enough
to contest the power of the king; probably no one
who had the desire. It is a remarkable fact, considering
the duration of the civil war, since the death
of Sigurd the Crusader, that the country apparently
recovered so soon from its effects. The period of
stagnation and decline did not occur until nearly a
century later, and may then have been in part attributable
to other and more immediate causes. The
seed, however, of destruction had been sown during
this disastrous epoch, even though it required a century
to sprout.</p>

<p>The return of peace left the king free to further
an ambition which he had long had at heart. In a
half unacknowledged way, he regarded his illegitimate
birth as a blot upon his 'scutcheon which he
was anxious to have removed. For this purpose he
desired to be crowned. He had made an effort to gain
the Pope's consent to such a ceremony during Skule's
lifetime, but his ever-active enemy had frustrated
his plan. Gregory IX. was now dead, as was also
his successor, Celestin IV., and St. Peter's chair was
occupied by Innocent IV., who had no prejudice
against Haakon. The bishops, as usual, endeavored
to exact fresh privileges, in return for their
good offices in this matter, proposing that the king,
on assuming the crown, should swear the same oath
as Magnus Erlingsson had sworn, acknowledging
himself the vassal of the Church, and taking the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
crown in fief from St. Olaf. But here they were met
by a firm refusal.</p>

<p>"If I should swear such an oath as King Magnus
swore," Haakon replied, "then methinks my honor
in being crowned would be diminished, instead of
increased. For King Magnus did not care what he
did in order to attain that to which he had no right.
But by God's help I shall not need to buy of you
what God has rightly chosen me to be, after my
father and my ancestors."</p>

<p>When the Pope's consent was obtained, Cardinal
William of Sabina was sent to Norway to set the
crown upon the king's head. But on arriving, he,
too, incited by the native prelates, was disposed to
exact conditions. Haakon, however, secure in his
right, maintained his attitude with firmness and dignity,
and in the end the cardinal had to accept his
terms. The coronation took place with great pomp
on St. Olaf's Day, July 29, 1247, in Christ's Church
in Bergen. The guests at the banquet which followed
the ceremony were so numerous that the
royal mansion could not hold them, and it became
necessary to fit out a huge boat-house as a temporary
banqueting hall. The feast continued for three days,
and outdid in magnificence any thing that had hitherto
been seen in the North. Then followed a five
days' <i>f&ecirc;te</i> in honor of the cardinal and the other
dignitaries. When the festivities were at an end, a
meeting was called at which affairs of state were
discussed, and the king voluntarily made several
concessions to the clergy. The right of the Church
to choose its own servants was confirmed, as also its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
right of separate jurisdiction. Ordeals were solemnly
abolished, because, as the cardinal expressed it, it was
not seemly for Christian men to challenge God to
give his verdict in human affairs.</p>

<p>At his departure from Norway, the cardinal received
a present of 15,000 marks sterling, or about
half a million francs, for his master the Pope, besides
a munificent compensation for his own services.</p>

<p>The remainder of Haakon's reign was externally
uneventful, and for that very reason beneficial to the
country. The king was wise enough to see that the
noisy deeds of war bring no enduring blessing, while
the industries of peace produce sound prosperity and
progress. He therefore devoted himself with unflagging
energy to the furtherance of agriculture and
trade. His chief interest was, however, architecture.
Cloisters, churches, and fortifications were built in
different parts of the country. His love of splendor
he indulged in the erection of a magnificent royal
mansion in Bergen, and his benevolence in the erection
of a hospital for lepers. In Troms&ouml; he put up
a church, which long enjoyed the distinction of being
the northernmost church in the world. The laws of
succession were so amended as to exclude illegitimate
sons; the civil and criminal codes were improved,
and the number of lawmen increased to eleven. A
well-equipped fleet of 300 ships was maintained,
which, in the hands of a peace-loving king, was a
guaranty of peace rather than a menace of war. By
embassies, by exchanges of gifts with foreign princes,
and by the power and splendor which he displayed
at home and abroad, Haakon gained a place among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the rulers of Europe, which had been accorded to
no Norwegian king before him. The German emperor,
the noble and gifted Frederick II., sought his
friendship, and maintained communication with him
until his death. The Russian grand duke, Alexander
Newsky, applied for the hand of his daughter, Christina,
for his son, and King Alfonso the Wise of
Castile wooed her for his brother. The suit of the
latter was accepted, and Christina married in 1257 the
Spanish prince, Don Philip. The Pope, Alexander
IV., endeavored to extort from Haakon a promise to
participate in a crusade, and the king of France,
Louis IX., offered him, "in view of his power and experience
on the seas," the command of an allied
Norse-French fleet; and to crown his honors, it is
said that the Pope in 1256 urged him as his candidate
for emperor of Germany.</p>

<p>What gave King Haakon, in spite of the remoteness
of his country, this extraordinary influence
abroad was particularly his fleet. During a brief
war with Denmark in 1256 and 1257, the awe which
the sight of this strong naval force inspired was so
great, that it induced the Danish king, Christopher,
to make peace on Haakon's terms without venturing
a battle. The Icelanders, enfeebled and brutalized
by perpetual internecine feuds, acknowledged his
supremacy and promised to pay him tribute (1261).
The few and scattered inhabitants of Greenland likewise
recognized his overlordship. A dispute concerning
the Orkneys and the Shetland Isles led to
war with the Scottish king, Alexander III. Haakon,
determined to maintain his power over these distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
dependencies, which had already cost Norway so much
blood and treasure, started with his fleet for Scotland
(1263), but suffered severely from a storm which
wrecked many of his ships. He sailed around to th
western side of Scotland, ravaged the coasts of
Cantire and Bute, and fought a battle at Largs (near
the entrance to the Firth of Clyde), in which, according
to the account of the Scots, the Norsemen were
defeated, while, according to the sagas, they were
victorious. At best, however, the battle afforded
them no advantage. For Haakon retired, immedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>ately
after, to the Orkneys, where he determined to
spend the winter, hoping to renew the campaign
again in the spring. Here he was suddenly taken
ill and died in Kirkevaag, December 15, 1263. During
his illness he had the sagas of his ancestors read
aloud to him, from Halfdan the Swarthy down to
the days of his grandfather, King Sverre. During
the reading of Sverre's saga he passed quietly away.</p>

<p>All records agree in the judgment that Haakon
Haakonsson was a wise and noble king. He was
not a man of genius, not endowed with the brilliant
gifts of his grandfather. But he was what we call a
safe man. He possessed strong common-sense; was
generous and forgiving, yet resolute and firm where
justice demanded severity. His noble heart and his
clear-sighted intelligence led him invariably to choose
the right. He was therefore a great king, without
being necessarily a great man, unless a well-balanced
combination of all average good qualities constitutes
in itself greatness. His enemy, Duke Skule, was in
many respects a more brilliant personality, and yet
what a misfortune it would have been to Norway, if
Skule had displaced Haakon!</p>

<p>In appearance Haakon resembled his grandfather.
He was, like him, of middle height, and had the same
large and wondrously expressive eyes. He looked
taller when he sat than when he stood, but his presence
was always dignified and impressive. He was
fifty-nine years old when he died, and had ruled over
Norway forty-six years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>THE STURLUNGS IN ICELAND.</h3>


<p>During the reign of Haakon Haakonsson lived
the renowned Icelandic historian, Snorre Sturlasson.
It is due to him that the ancient history of Norway
has been saved from oblivion. His great work,
called <i>Heimskringla</i> (the Circle of the Earth), after
the words with which it begins, is a coherent and in
the main reliable record of the events which took
place in Norway from the time of Harold the Fairhaired
down to the Battle of Ree in 1177. The
more or less mythical history which precedes the
reign of Harold is also included, though it can
scarcely, in many features, lay claim to credibility.
The style is clear and vigorous, and the characterizations
are extremely vivid. Scaldic lays are introduced
into the text as evidences of the veracity of the narrative,
and anecdotes are preserved which throw a
strong light upon the characters of the heroes. The
Heimskringla is, accordingly, not a loose conglomeration
of fact and fiction, such as monkish chroniclers
in the Middle Ages were in the habit of composing,
but a historic work of high rank, betraying a
mature critical spirit and artistic taste, in style and
arrangement. Several scaldic lays are also attributed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
to Snorre, besides portions of the Younger Edda&mdash;a
collection of myths and legends, dealing with the
traditions of the ancient Asa faith. It is as editor
and collector, however, not as author, that he is here
entitled to credit.</p>

<p>Snorre Sturlasson was born in Iceland in 1178, and
was, at the age of three, adopted by the great chieftain,
Jon Loftsson, a grandson of Saemund the
Learned. His father was Sturla Thordsson, a high-born
but turbulent man, and his mother, Gudny
B&ouml;dvar's daughter. Jon Loftsson had inherited a
very considerable collection of historical MSS. from
his grandfather, Saemund, and his house was the
home of the best culture which the island at that
time possessed. Snorre, though any thing but a
book-worm, became interested in the myths and tales
of paganism, and by intercourse with his foster-father
imbibed a taste for historical research. After
the death of the latter in 1198, he found himself
penniless, his mother having wasted his paternal
inheritance. In order to maintain his dignity, he
was therefore obliged to look about for a rich marriage,
and by the aid of his brothers succeeded in
gaining the hand of the wealthiest heiress in Iceland.
He now devoted himself to the task of increasing
his power. By shrewd bargaining, by intimidation,
and by open violence he gained possession of six
large estates and amassed an enormous fortune.
Iceland, at that time, was torn with factional feuds,
and Snorre understood to perfection the art of fishing
in troubled waters. He was a man of energetic
and determined character&mdash;a man of large plans and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
few scruples. There is a vigorous worldliness visible
in all his acts, and a prudent adaptation of means to
ends. At his residence, Reykjaholt, which he fortified,
improved, and beautified in a manner, the like
of which had never been seen in Iceland, he lived
like a prince, maintaining an armed force which
seemed to threaten the republic. Ruins of his bath-house
are yet to be seen, and yet bear his name
(Snorrelaug). The bath was built of hewn stones,
and the hot water was conducted by a stone aqueduct
from the neighboring geysers.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">

<br />
<span class="caption">H&Ouml;RGADAL IN THE NORTH OF ICELAND.</span>
</div>

<p>Snorre had two brothers, Thord and Sighvat.
The former was of a quiet disposition, and not over-ambitious,
while the latter was Snorre's counterpart,
and like him engaged in increasing his fortune by
trickery and violence.</p>

<p>Two men, thus constituted, would scarcely be restrained
by their fraternal relation, when their interests
clashed; and before long, we find Sighvat and
Snorre at swords' points.</p>

<p>By the weight of his influence, Snorre gradually
absorbed the more important offices in the gift of
his countrymen. Thus he was, in 1215, elected
speaker of the law, and in this capacity came in conflict
with his foster-brother, Saemund Jonsson, who
took exception to one of his rulings. The Icelandic
Althing was both a legislative assembly and a
supreme court, and it was the duty of the speaker in
legal cases to decide what was law. If any of the
contending parties rejected the decision of the Althing,
an appeal to the sword was always open to
him. The law was a consultative, not an absolute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
power, and depended upon its fairness for its authority.
Snorre, whose duty it was to give weight to
the law, had so small respect for his office, that he
appeared with eight hundred and forty armed men,
determined to overawe his opponents. A compromise
was with difficulty arranged, but the seed of
mischief had been sown, and was not slow to sprout
and bear fruit.</p>

<p>Snorre's fame had, in the meanwhile, reached Norway,
and many honorable invitations were extended
to him from the foremost chieftains of the land.
Accordingly he set sail in 1218, with a large train of
followers, visited King Haakon and Earl Skule, and
gained the latter's friendship. The king made him
his liegeman, and it is said that Snorre promised
Skule to bring Iceland under the dominion of the
mother country. The plan was a tempting one. If
by the surrender of the liberties of the island, he
could attain the dignity of Earl of Iceland, he could,
at one blow, by Skule's aid, crush all his enemies, and
reign undisputed as the first man in the land. On
his return home, however, he discovered that the
obstacles in his way were greater than he had anticipated.
It appears, even, that he repented of his
rash promise, and was anxious to postpone the day of
its fulfilment. Whether, in his subsequent machinations,
he meant to secure his own predominance, as a
means to carrying out his bargain with the earl, is
difficult to determine.</p>

<p>In 1222 Snorre's rival and bitterest enemy, Saemund
Jonsson, died, and his children, who were at
variance about an inheritance from their uncle, Orm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
Jonsson, called upon Snorre to arbitrate between
them. They did this, not because they loved him
and had confidence in his fairness, but because they
feared him and were anxious to have the old feud
terminated. Snorre understood this perfectly, and
had no hesitation in taking advantage of his position.
Having recently been separated from his wife, he
saw a chance of further enriching himself by marrying
the beautiful Solveig, the sister of the contending
brothers. He accordingly divided the inheritance
so as to give her the lion's share; but just as he
seemed to have made sure of his game, his nephew,
Sturla Sighvatsson, stepped up and snatched the girl
from his expectant arms. By his unfair arbitration,
he thus benefited the man who was henceforth
to become his most dangerous enemy. Nothing
daunted, however, Snorre turned his attention to
another and far wealthier heiress, whom he succeeded
in marrying. By a series of bargains, in which he
made an unscrupulous use of the fear which his name
inspired, he continued to increase his wealth, until
his power overshadowed that of all other chieftains
in the island. Sturla, who in shrewdness and daring
was more than a match for his uncle, pursued a similar
course, and with the perpetual clashing of interests
their hostility grew more pronounced. Snorre
had, in the meanwhile, by his friendship for Earl Skule,
incurred the enmity of King Haakon. Sturla on
his return from a pilgrimage to Rome, succeeded in
gaining the king's confidence, and in deepening his
distrust of Snorre. He made now the same bargain
with the king that his uncle had previously made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>with Skule, promising, in return for the dignity of
Earl of Iceland, to bring the country under the Norwegian
crown. On his return home, he did not,
however, at once venture to attack his rival, but contented
himself with picking quarrels with his son,
Ur&ouml;kja, and his son-in-law, Gissur Thorvaldsson.
The former he captured and maimed, but in his conflict
with the latter he succumbed. In a regular
battle, which was fought in 1238, both Sturla and his
father, Sighvat, were killed. Snorre was at that time
in Norway, where he had the imprudence to commit
himself as a partisan of Skule, and thereby still further
incensed the king. Contrary to the command
of the latter, he returned to Iceland, where his predominance
seemed now secured. But King Haakon,
who henceforth regarded him as an open enemy, became
the means of his destruction. Snorre had
already, by his rapacity and greed, incurred the hostility
of his son-in law, Gissur Thorvaldsson, and
with him the king opened negotiations, demanding
of him that he should either kill his father-in-law or
send him as a prisoner to Norway. Gissur accordingly
attacked Snorre at Reykjaholt with seventy
armed men, and slew him (1241).</p>

</div>

<p>Snorre's nephew, Sturla Thordsson, who at one
time was a great chieftain and a defender of Icelandic
independence, continued the Heimskringla in
his uncle's spirit, writing the Saga of Haakon
Haakonsson. This is a model biography, clearly and
vigorously written, and abounding in interesting details.
Another remarkable book, which was written
in Norway during Haakon's reign, is the so-called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
King's Mirror (Konungsskuggsj&aacute;). It contains, in
the shape of a dialogue between father and son,
moral teachings and rules of life and conduct. Its
maxims of worldly wisdom and rules of etiquette give
a vivid insight into the modes of life and thought in
the thirteenth century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>MAGNUS LAW-MENDER (1263-1280).</h3>


<p>With the death of Haakon Haakonsson, the continuous
story of the sagas ceases. A fragment of
the life of his son, Magnus Law-Mender (Lagab&ouml;ter),
written by Sturla Thordsson, is preserved, but the
greater portion has unhappily been lost. What is
known concerning the later kings, during the period
of independence, is derived from many scattered and
often unreliable sources. A period of decline, at
first gradual and imperceptible, set in with the reign
of King Magnus, and culminated in the loss of independence.</p>

<p>Magnus had been proclaimed king during his
father's lifetime, and as he was of age, the government
passed into his hands without dispute. Being
indisposed to continue the expensive war with Scotland,
he sent his chancellor, Askatin, to Alexander
III. and obtained peace on the condition of ceding
the Island of Man and the Shetland Isles, receiving
in return 4,000 marks sterling, besides an annual
tribute of 100 marks. The latter stipulation was
intended to save appearances, as an annual tribute
might well be interpreted as a continued recognition
of the supremacy of the king of Norway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>It has often been questioned whether Magnus
acted wisely in refusing to draw the sword to preserve
the integrity of his kingdom. That the Scottish
isles already had cost Norway more in blood and
treasure than they were worth, is generally conceded;
and the chances were that, as Scotland increased in
power, still greater efforts would be required to assert
the sway of Norway over the remote dependencies.
Moreover, as England later rose to become a European
power and absorbed Scotland, it was merely a
question of time when Norway would be compelled
to relax its hold upon the islands. Whether it was
a mere native disinclination to fight, or a careful
counting of the cost, which induced Magnus to depart
from his father's policy, time seems to have justified
the wisdom of his course. For all that, it is undeniable
that the respect and influence abroad which
Norway had gained by Haakon's assertion of the
national dignity, were much diminished by the unwarlike
spirit of his son. He had indeed the satisfaction
to add Iceland to his possessions. But even
this was in no wise due to his skill or merit. It was
apparently the result of King Haakon's interference
in the feuds of the Sturlungs, but in a deeper sense
it was due to causes which do not lie so near the surface.
The descendants of the proud men who, during
the reign of Harold the Fairhaired, emigrated from
Norway, merely because they would not surrender
their allodial rights, would not have surrendered liberty
itself without resistance, if they had not sadly
degenerated from their ancestors.</p>

<p>Liberty had in Iceland long ago degenerated into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
license. No law had the power to bind the strong.
It is a mistake to suppose that the institutions of the
country were democratic. Though theoretically the
rights of every free man were recognized, in practice
they soon came to amount to very little. Icelandic society
early separated itself into a yeomanry or peasantry
and an aristocracy. The latter, who had the
government entirely in their hands, proceeded by a
series of bloody feuds to exterminate each other,
until, of the fifty or more ruling families, scarcely
half a dozen were left in possession of their dignity
and power. As a matter of course, these half a
dozen then endeavored to cut each other's throats,
and, as the struggle grew fiercer, welcomed aid from
any source and at any price. All public interests
were lost sight of in the furious strife for personal
ascendency. The proud sense of independence,
which had been the glory of the race, developed into
a mere ferocious passion for power, and a savage determination
to crush out rivalry. Civic rights, moral
obligations, and the bonds of blood were equally disregarded;
brother waged war against brother and
father against son. Murder and arson were every-day
occurrences. Complete anarchy prevailed. Of
this state of things Haakon Haakonsson took advantage,
and by aiding one faction against the other
secured the allegiance of the conquering party and
thereby the submission of the island itself to the
crown of Norway. Snorre's son-in-law and slayer,
Gissur Thorvaldsson, was the first Earl of Iceland.
He received the dignity from King Haakon (1258),
before his countrymen had yet recognized the latter's
overlordship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
If it be true that the happiest nations are those
which have no history, it may be safe to conclude
that the happiest periods of a nation's life are the
most uneventful. If so, the reign of Magnus Haakonsson
afforded every chance of happiness to his
subjects. The peasant cultivated contentedly his
fields, and, undisturbed, the merchant and the artisan
pursued their avocations. The development of the
resources of the country afforded the king satisfaction,
and he did all in his power to further every
peaceful industry. To this end he also interested
himself in legislation, and spent many years of his
life in revising the laws and making them uniform.
Formerly the country had been divided into four
judicial districts, each with its own <i>thing</i> and
its own laws. The Frosta-<i>thing's</i> code was the
law of Tr&ouml;ndelag, the Gula-<i>thing's</i> code was valid
on the western coast, the Eidsivia code in the Oplands,
and the Borgar-<i>thing's</i> code in Viken. Out of
these four, Magnus now caused a new general code
to be elaborated for the whole country, abolishing
what was antiquated, removing inconsistencies and
adapting the spirit of the legislation to the needs of
the age. For four hundred years his laws remained
in force, and a few of them have remained until recent
times. All things, great and small, relating to
civic life interested him; and a certain over-confidence
in the power of law to regulate all human concerns
is traceable in his labors. For the cities he
elaborated a municipal law, and for his vassals and
courtiers a court law (<i>Hirdskraa</i>), which was, however,
an adaptation of a previously existing code,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
dating from the days of Sverre. The court law dealt
with the feudal duties and privileges of vassals, prescribed
rules for courtly intercourse, and a fixed
ceremonial for the proclamation of a king, the conferring
of the feudal dignities, etc. Among other
things it ordained that no longer, as of old, should a
peasant, as the representative of the people, confer
the royal dignity upon the heir to the throne, but
the man of highest rank present.</p>

<p>An inclination is visible in King Magnus' legislation
to break with the democratic past, and to
remodel Norway, as nearly as possible, after foreign
patterns. It was particularly England, with its
feudal institutions, which seemed to him and his
surroundings worthy of imitation. Although it was
by no means a pure democracy which had prevailed
in Norway hitherto, there had yet been a recognition
of the people as the source of power, and the
old stubborn sense of independence which characterized
the peasantry had never been eradicated.
Hitherto the laws had been submitted to the people
at the <i>things</i>, where every free-born man could make
himself heard. Now this venerable custom was
abolished, and the king and his council reserved for
themselves the right to make and repeal laws, without
consulting the people. That this decree was
accepted without protest, nay appears to have
caused no particular excitement, shows plainly the
change that had come over the spirit of the Norsemen.
If a king had proposed such a law, in the days
of Haakon the Good or Olaf Tryggvesson, he would
have risked his throne and his life. Whether it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
because royalty had risen to such dignity and power
that it seemed hopeless to oppose it, or because the
tribal aristocracy, instead of making common cause
with the people, had attached itself to the crown,
certain it is that the supine acceptance of so radical
a change argued a degeneracy which explains the subsequent
events.</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be wondered at that the rise of
feudalism throughout Europe, during the thirteenth
century, also had its effect upon the institutions of
Norway. The ideas which Magnus embodied in his
laws were, so to speak, in the air; and the commercial
intercourse with England had familiarized the
Norsemen with the titles and the pomp and circumstance
of chivalry. Thus the Royal Council, consisting
of the chancellor, the earls, and the liegemen,
was obviously copied after the English institution of
the same name, and, to make the resemblance complete,
the ancient title of liegeman was abolished
and that of baron substituted. The court officials
were made knights and squires.<a name="FNanchor_A_66" id="FNanchor_A_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_66" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> A privileged
class was thus raised distinctly above the people;
and the foundation laid for a hereditary nobility.
A partial immunity from taxes was granted to barons
and knights, and the lucrative offices in the gift of
the crown were parcelled out among them. Though
some elements of the ancient tribal aristocracy were
absorbed in the new order, there was also a large
element which owed its rise purely to royal favor.
It is thus to be noted, that the new nobility of Norway
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>was in the main a court nobility, which depended
upon the crown for its dignity, and could not be
expected, when occasion demanded, to antagonize
the king in the interest of the people. It therefore
shared the fate of royalty and lost its power when
the royal house became extinct. For the later
rulers, the Danish kings, were surrounded by a
hungry aristocracy of their own, whose fortunes they
were bound to push, and the Norse candidates for
their favor had to be neglected. Thus it happened
that the Norse aristocracy again returned to the
people, from which it had originally risen. It was
gradually absorbed by and identified with the peasantry,
which thereby gained more than the nobles
lost. "A compact class of allodial freeholders was
formed, which, on account of their numbers and
their remoteness from public affairs, may be styled a
peasantry, but by reason of their liberty and self-assertion
almost maintained the rank of a nobility."<a name="FNanchor_B_67" id="FNanchor_B_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_67" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_66" id="Footnote_A_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_66"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> It is impossible to give an adequate translation of the word <i>herra</i>
in this connection. It is a lower title than baron and knight.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_67" id="Footnote_B_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_67"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> J. Sars: Udsigt over Norge's Historie, ii., 399.</p></div>

<p>It is this proud peasant-nobility which until this
day have constituted the strength of the Norse people
and the bulwark of its re-arisen liberty. They have
at all times, even during the darkest days of the union
with Denmark, constituted a force with which the
government had to reckon.</p>

<p>In spite of his conciliatory disposition, King Magnus'
reign had its share of quarrels and disturbances.
Chief among these was his controversy with the
Church, which ended, on his part, with an abject surrender.
The archbishop, at that time, was the haughty
and ambitious Jon the Red (R&ouml;de), who, before consenting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>to a change in the law of succession, which
the king had much at heart, extorted from him a
series of humiliating concessions. At a meeting of
notables in Tunsberg (1277), Magnus bound himself
to abstain from all interference in the selection of
bishops, and to surrender to the latter the right of
filling, in accordance with their pleasure, all the clerical
offices. He conceded, moreover, to the archbishop
the privilege of coining money and to have a
hundred men in his personal service, who should be
exempt from feudal obligations to the king.</p>

<p>In his relation to foreign powers Magnus was
equally unsuccessful in maintaining the dignity of
his crown. When his brother-in-law, the Swedish
king, Valdemar, begged him for help against his
brother Magnus, who had deprived him of the
greater part of his kingdom, preparations were indeed
made for a grand campaign, but after several futile
meetings and much talk, the Norwegian fleet was
ordered home again and the Swedish king was left
to his fate. To a proud and adventurous people like
the Norsemen, jealous of their dignity at home and
abroad, this unconquerable reluctance to draw the
sword must have appeared humiliating. A high
regard for honor and a genius for war had characterized
the race up to this time; and however much
one may disapprove of war, one cannot deny that
peace may be bought at too high a price. The right
to hold one's head high; to feel proud of one's history
and one's country, is a precious privilege, without
which no race ever achieved great things. King
Magnus, by lessening the prestige which the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
had enjoyed during the reign of his father, therefore
contributed much toward the decadence which followed.</p>

<p>Physically as well as mentally, signs of degeneracy
are beginning to be perceptible in the royal race of
Norway. King Magnus was, indeed, endowed with
a good intellect and his morals were blameless. But
for all that, he was a far less sturdy and impressive
personality than his father, and a still greater distance
separated him from his great-grandfather, the wise,
brave, gentle, unconquerable Sverre. Many of his
imprudent acts are explained by the fact that his
health was never vigorous. While he was yet in the
prime of life, he began to suffer from ailments which
warned his councillors that his days were numbered.
He died in 1280, at the age of forty-one.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>ERIK PRIEST-HATER (1280-1299).</h3>


<p>The barons, who had acquired extensive privileges
during the reign of King Magnus, had a chance to
establish their power still more securely during the
minority of his son Erik, who, at his father's death,
was but twelve years old. A great influence was also
wielded by the imperious queen-dowager, Ingeborg,
who made common cause with the barons and was
the real soul of the regency. Of her two surviving sons,
Duke Haakon, the younger, was the more fitted, by
strength of body and mind, to occupy the throne.
He received great fiefs, and though recognizing
Erik's overlordship, conducted himself as an independent
sovereign. He issued decrees, coined money,
and made independent alliances with foreign princes.
His brother was a weak, good-natured man who
never knew how to assert his will against that of his
mother and his high-handed councillors. The latter,
among whom the barons, Hallkell Agmundsson,
Audun Hugleiksson, and Bjarne Erlingsson of Giske
and Bjark&ouml;, were the most eminent, disapproved
highly of the concessions which King Magnus had
made to the Church, and were watching for an opportunity
to check the power and arrogance of the clergy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
They found it necessary, however, to conceal their
plans, until the king had been crowned by Archbishop
Jon, and they even consented to have him
include in the coronation oath the promise "to yield
all due honor to the clergy and the bishops, and to
repeal all bad laws, especially such as might conflict
with the liberty of the Church."</p>

<p>The archbishop interpreted this promise literally,
and demanded after the coronation the repeal of the
laws in question. The queen and the barons were,
however, not disposed to yield a single point, but
rather welcomed the opportunity to measure strength
with the domineering prelates. It was of no use
that the archbishop put Hallkell Agmundsson in
the ban; his colleagues only honored him more conspicuously,
and when Queen Ingeborg and Bjarne
Erlingsson received the same punishment, they, as
well as the people, showed an indifference, which left
the archbishop powerless. After having vainly appealed
to the Pope, and having been foiled at the
Roman Curia by ambassadors from the barons, Jon
the Red and two other bishops were outlawed and
compelled to leave the country. The archbishop
died in exile in Sweden in 1282.</p>

<p>The king, who was yet a mere boy, was neutral in
this struggle. If the decision had rested with him,
he would probably have continued his father's policy
of concession, and the epithet "Priest-Hater," which
has been attached to his name, is therefore undeserved.</p>

<p>When Erik was fourteen years old, he was married
to Margaret of Scotland, the daughter of his grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>father's
enemy, King Alexander III. The young
queen died, however, a year later, after having
given birth to a daughter, who, on the death of
King Alexander (1284), was acknowledged as the
heir to the throne of Scotland. While yet a child
(1290), the Maid of Norway, as she was called, embarked
for the land which she was to rule, but died
before reaching it. Her father then, as his daughter's
heir, laid claim to the Scottish crown, but the
armed interference of King Edward I. of England
compelled him to abandon his candidacy. He had
at that time another controversy on his hands,
which threatened serious results.</p>

<p>The queen-dowager, Ingeborg, was the daughter
of the Danish king, Erik Plowpenny. His nephew,
Erik Glipping, who succeeded his father, Christopher
I., refused to surrender her inheritance, which
consisted in landed estates in different parts of the
kingdom. Magnus Law-Mender had vainly insisted
upon the surrender of the property, and Erik, at
the instigation of his mother, resumed negotiations,
and, when these resulted in nothing, made threatening
demonstrations. The Norse baron, Sir Alf
Erlingsson, a special favorite of the queen, began to
prey upon the shipping in the Sound, and by his
recklessness and daring, made his name dreaded
among seamen and merchants. He did, indeed,
inflict much injury upon Danish commerce, and
ravaged the coasts of Jutland and Halland; but the
principal sufferers were the cities of the Hanseatic
League, which, by the concessions of Magnus Law-Mender,
had obtained a virtual monopoly of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
foreign trade of Norway. Their ships were now
seized without mercy by the noble pirate, who
added insult to injury by once appearing incognito
among them in an open boat, and bargaining
with them about the price which they had set
upon his head. It was of no use that the League
sent out ships of war to capture him; he out-man&#339;uvred
them, deceived them, sent them on a
wild-goose chase, and ended by capturing his would-be
captors. Though not officially authorized to
carry on war in this fashion, Sir Alf perceived that
his performances were winked at by the queen-dowager,
who was actually so gratified at his success,
that she had him created an earl, and induced
the king to use him as his ambassador to England.
As allies of the King of Denmark, the Hanseatic
cities were, in the queen's opinion, entitled to no
consideration, but she forgot in her blind hostility
that they had it in their power to take revenge.
Partly on account of the risk, partly as a measure
of retaliation, the Hansa forbade the importation
of grain and other staples of food to Norway, and
the result was famine and misery. The hostilities
with Denmark in the meanwhile continued, but
were, after the death of Queen Ingeborg (1287),
conducted, not by piracy, but by open warfare.
A conspiracy was formed against the life of King
Erik Glipping, and he was murdered, while on the
chase (1286), by Marshal Stig, Count Jacob of Halland,
and others. The murderers, who were outlawed
in Denmark, found a refuge in Norway, and
accompanied King Erik on his campaign against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
their native country in 1289. The city of Elsinore
was burned, and the Norwegian fleet lay for four
weeks near Copenhagen, serving as a basis of operations
for the outlawed king-slayers, who satisfied
their private vengeance by burning cities and castles.
Three similar expeditions, during the following
six years, brought Erik neither honor nor profit
in proportion to the cost of the enterprise; although,
in the end, the Danish king, Erik Menved,
was compelled to conclude an armistice for
three years at Hinsgavl, in Funen (1295), at
which he made a definite promise of the surrender
of the disputed property. The king-slayers were
permitted to return unmolested to their homes,
and their estates were to be restored to them.</p>

<p>The war with the Hanseatic cities had come to an
end long before, by the peace of Kalmar, (1285). The
formidable weapon which they wielded, in their
ability to cut off supplies, gave them so great an advantage
that King Erik had no choice but to accept
their terms. King Magnus of Sweden, who, according
to mutual agreement, had been selected as
umpire negotiated peace, on the conditions that King
Erik should return to their owners all ships which
had been captured, pay an indemnity of six thousand
marks and greatly extend the commercial privileges
of the Hansa. Thus the lawless valor of "Little Sir
Alf," as the pirate earl was called, proved no less disastrous
to his country than it did to himself. He
did not appreciate the difference which the death of
the queen had made in his position; but continued
to tread law and honor under foot with defiant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
heedlessness. The baron, Sir Hallkell Agmundsson
the commander of Oslo Castle, had for some reason incurred
his hostility; and Earl Alf gathered, in the
ancient fashion, a band of adventurers about him
and commenced a rebellion, as it appears, against
Duke Haakon, who was Sir Hallkell's protector. He
even had the audacity to attack Oslo, set fire to the
town, capture his foe, and after a brief imprisonment
executed him. This daring murder brought upon
him a sentence of outlawry; and he was forced to
seek refuge in Sweden, where King Magnus took
him under his protection. His luck had, however,
deserted him, for when again he appeared as a corsair
in Danish waters, he was captured and brought in
irons into the presence of Queen Agnes. According
to the ballad, she twitted him on the smallness of his
stature; to which he replied that she would never
live to see the day when she could bear such a son.
Another and still more insolent remark made the
queen so furious that she struck her fist against the
table and declared that Little Sir Alf should be tortured
on the rack, and his bones broken on the wheel.
The sentence was executed the following day (1290).</p>

<p>After the death of his first queen, King Erik had
married Isabella Bruce, the sister of Robert, who
later became King of Scotland. He had by this
marriage a daughter, Ingeborg, who became the wife
of Duke Valdemar, the brother of the Swedish
king, Birger Magnusson. King Erik died at the age
of thirty-one (1299), after having been king for nineteen
years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3>HAAKON LONGLEGS (HAALEGG), 1299-1319.</h3>


<p>Duke Haakon, the second son of Magnus Law-Mender,
succeeded his brother without opposition.
He was then twenty-nine years old, tall and of stately
appearance. He had not been long upon the throne,
before he showed the haughty barons that he meant
to have a reckoning with them. He first summoned
Sir Audun Hugleiksson to meet him in Bergen,
tried him for treason, and had him executed (1302).
A woman from L&uuml;beck had, two years before, appeared
in Norway and created much excitement by
claiming to be the Princess Margaret, "The Maid of
Norway," who had died on the Orkneys. Her trial
proved her to be an impostor, and she was burned at
the stake. According to one conjecture, Sir Audun
was in some way compromised by her trial, and it is
not unlikely that he may have encouraged her pretensions.
The legend, however, relates that Sir Audun
suffered death for having insulted the king's
bride, Countess Euphemia of Arnstein, whom, in
1295, he brought over from Germany.</p>

<p>It must have been an unpleasant surprise to the
barons, who had had their own way so long, to find a
stern and determined master in the new king, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
is the more to his credit that, in spite of their hostility,
he induced them to consent to a change in
the law of succession in favor of his daughter Ingeborg
and her issue. As he was the only male descendant
in the direct line of the old royal house, it
was a source of uneasiness to him that he had no
sons, and he foresaw that the only means of averting
civil war, after his death, was to secure the succession
to the prospective sons of his daughter, and in case
she had none, to herself. Princess Ingeborg was,
while a mere child, promised in marriage to the brilliant
and ambitious Duke Erik, the second son of
King Magnus Birgersson of Sweden. By this betrothal,
King Haakon became involved in the quarrels
of the dukes Erik and Valdemar with their brother,
Birger Magnusson, whom they were endeavoring
to dethrone. The dukes hated the king, and the
king, who was jealous of Erik's popularity and eminence
in chivalrous accomplishments, reciprocated
their feelings. The long-smouldering hostility at
last blazed forth, in 1306, when the dukes treacherously
assaulted their brother and held him captive
for about eighteen months. King Haakon was induced
to take their part in the struggle, perhaps
chiefly because his enemy, the king of Denmark,
made common cause with King Birger. The good
understanding between them did not, however, last
long, for when it began to look as if Duke Erik
aimed at the union of the three Scandinavian kingdoms
under his own sceptre, Haakon, as an interested
party, could scarcely remain inactive. He demanded
the restoration of the fiefs which he had granted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
duke during his exile. When this was refused, he
opened negotiations with the king of Denmark, who
was the brother-in-law of King Birger, and concluded
a preliminary treaty at Copenhagen (1308) in accordance
with which the Princess Ingeborg was to marry
Magnus, the son of King Birger. Duke Erik then
invaded Norway with an army, took Oslo and vainly
besieged the fortress of Akershus. The province of
Jemteland was also attacked by the Swedes, and the
duke had in 1309 an indecisive fight with a portion
of the Norwegian fleet in Kalfsund. Finally, after
another fight, in which Erik gained the upper hand,
negotiations were resumed, and by mutual concessions
peace was re&euml;stablished (1310). Duke Erik had
a powerful ally at the Norwegian court in Queen
Euphemia, whose love for him was not of an entirely
maternal character. He had thus little difficulty in
conciliating King Haakon and getting again the
promise of his daughter's hand. The wedding was
finally celebrated with much splendor in Oslo in 1312.
Duke Valdemar married the same day the king's
niece, Ingeborg, the daughter of King Erik Priest-Hater.
About four years later, when the hope had
almost been abandoned, each of the duchesses bore
a son. King Haakon's joy at this happy event was
great, for it relieved him of his anxiety for the succession.
But his joy was of short duration. There
was one man in Sweden who was not rejoiced at the
birth of the young princes, and that was King Birger.
He feigned, however, delight, and invited his
brothers to a great feast of reconciliation at the castle
of Nyk&ouml;ping. When the festivities were at an end,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the dukes were thrown into prison and deprived of
their lives. As there was no sign of violence on
their bodies, the rumor went abroad that they had
been starved to death. This was probably true.
The tidings of this calamity gave King Haakon such
a shock that he never recovered from it. He died,
1319, aged forty-nine years. With him the male line
of the race of Harold the Fairhaired became extinct.</p>

<p>The war with Denmark which had lasted twenty-eight
years, was continued in a desultory fashion
during Haakon's reign, but no important battles
were fought. He used his fleet mainly as a threat
to enforce his claims. All that he gained was the
temporary possession of the province of Northern
Halland, as security for the final surrender of his maternal
inheritance.</p>

<p>In internal affairs King Haakon exhibited, according
to the ideas of his age, no mean degree of statesmanship.
His administration was both prudent and
vigorous. He checked the usurpations of the Hanseatic
cities, which were driving native merchants
out of the foreign trade, and deprived them of some of
their privileges. An honest intention to do right,
coupled with considerable ability, characterized both
his public and private life. For all that, his despotic
temper tended to alienate the people from public
affairs; and thus prepared the way for the following
centuries of humiliation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3>MAGNUS SMEK (1319-1374), HAAKON MAGNUSSON
(1355-1380), AND OLAF THE YOUNG
(1381-1387).</h3>


<p>Magnus Eriksson, the son of Duke Erik and
Ingeborg, was only three years old when his grandfather
died, and the government therefore fell into
the hands of a regency, the members of which had
already been designated by King Haakon. Shortly
before, a rebellion had broken out in Sweden against
King Birger, who, on account of the murder of his
brothers, was detested by his people. He was deposed
and his son Magnus, though he was in no wise
responsible for his father's crimes, was executed. At
the instance of the regent, Mats Kettilmundsson,
Magnus Eriksson was proclaimed king; and Norway
and Sweden were thus for the first time united under
one ruler. The union was a mere nominal one, the
two countries having separate laws and administrations,
and nothing in common except the king,
who was to divide his time equally between them.
During Magnus' minority, however, his mother,
Duchess Ingeborg, governed in Norway with the
utmost recklessness, making great scandal by her
love of the Danish nobleman Knut Porse, duke of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
Halland, whom she later married. To enrich him
she squandered the revenues and forfeited her popularity.
When the treasury was on the verge of
bankruptcy and loud murmurs of discontent were
heard from all sides, the duchess was at last deprived
of her power, and Sir Erling Vidkunsson of Bjark&ouml;
and Giske was made regent in her place.</p>

<p>When King Magnus, surnamed Smek, reached his
majority, he assumed the government in both countries
(1332). Being born a Swede, he lacked comprehension
of the Norsemen, and showed little interest
in their affairs. He was a weak and good-natured
man, anxious to please all, and therefore succeeded
in pleasing no one. In Sweden he had his hands full,
in endeavoring to control the unruly nobility, whose
pretensions were supported by his oldest son, Erik.
He therefore rarely came to Norway, and made no
adequate provision for the government during his
absence. Erling Vidkunsson then made himself the
spokesman of the universal discontent, and with other
magnates compelled the king, at a meeting in Bergen
(1350), to take his second son, Haakon, as co-regent
and to abdicate the crown of Norway, in his favor,
as soon as he should have reached his majority. It
was then understood that Erik would be his father's
successor in Sweden. But unforseen events frustrated
this expectation. In 1359 Magnus and his
queen, the wily and malicious Blanca of Namur,
made a visit to King Valdemar Atterdag in Copenhagen.
It was there arranged that Haakon should
marry Valdemar's eldest daughter and heir, Margaret,
and that the Danish king should extend his protec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>tion
to Queen Blanca's favorite, Bengt Algotsson,
whom Erik had declared to be a public enemy and
was determined to destroy. At the instigation of
King Valdemar, she chose, however, an easier way to
accomplish her baneful purposes. She poisoned her
son. Haakon was now heir both to Norway and
Sweden, and his and Margaret's issue, presumptively,
to Denmark. The Swedes were by no means pleased
with this arrangement, and the Norwegian magnates
would, if they had been consulted, have expressed
themselves no less strongly against it. They must
have foreseen in this union the inevitable decay of
the Norse national spirit and the gradual extinction
of their nationality. The Swedes, being a larger people,
had less to fear from it, but yet regarded it as
prejudicial to their interests. Their feeling toward
Denmark was not, just then, of a friendly character,
chiefly owing to the pusillanimity of their king, in
ceding the provinces Skaane, Halland, and Blekinge
to the latter country, without any adequate return,
unless it was a pledge of aid from King Valdemar
against his own subjects. So secure felt Magnus in
his new alliance, that he actually helped the Danish
king to conquer the Swedish island Gottland, and
permitted him to sack the town of Visby, which was
one of the principal depots of the Baltic trade.</p>

<p>Now, the patience of the Swedes was at last exhausted.
The Royal Council, supported by the nobility,
declared that King Magnus, as well as his son
Haakon, had forfeited their rights to the crown
(1363), and called Duke Albrecht of Mecklenburg to
the succession. Weak as he was, however, Magnus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
was not minded to give up his kingdom without a
struggle. With whatever troops he could scrape
together from the provinces which were yet faithful
to him, he attacked King Albrecht at Enk&ouml;ping, but
was defeated and taken prisoner. Haakon, dangerously
wounded, made his escape into Norway.
Though the Norwegians cared little for Magnus,
they were too loyal to refuse Haakon their aid in his
attempt to liberate him from the horrible prison in
which he was languishing. The war was therefore
continued with varying success until the Hanseatic
League interfered and came near deciding it in
Albrecht's favor. The German merchants had, during
the feeble government of Magnus, obtained so
great a power in Norway that they trod justice under
foot, slew their enemies, refused to accept the king's
money (which was not good), and leagued together
to defy the laws and protect each other from punishment.
The king was so incensed at their arrogant
conduct, that he issued a decree expelling all Germans
from the country. Unhappily he had not the
power to enforce obedience to this mandate, and
when the Hansa made war upon him, he was obliged
to buy peace by further concessions. This left him
comparatively free, however, to prosecute the war
with King Albrecht, and when all negotiations had
proved futile, he advanced with an army upon Stockholm,
laying the country waste as he progressed.
Here, at last, peace was concluded (1371) on the condition
that Haakon should pay a ransom of twelve
thousand marks for his father and renounce his claim
to the throne of Sweden. In return, Magnus was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
receive Skara-Stift, Vesterg&ouml;tland, and Vermeland.
The old king was, however, not to enjoy long his
dearly bought liberty. Three years later he was
drowned in the B&ouml;mmelfjord in Norway (1374), and
his son only survived him six years. Like so many
of the kings of Norway, he died in his prime (1380).</p>

<p>The reigns of Magnus Eriksson and his son were a
period of great disaster to Norway. In 1344 the
Gula-Elv suddenly changed its course, owing to the
fall of an enormous rock into its bed, and forty-eight
farms were destroyed, and two hundred and fifty
people and a multitude of cattle were drowned. In
Iceland an earthquake and a great eruption of Hekla
spread alarm and desolation. But the worst of all
calamities was the Black Death, a terrible pestilence,
which, after having ravaged Germany, England, and
Southern Europe, reached Norway in 1349. An
English merchant vessel first brought the pestilence
to Bergen, whence it spread with great rapidity
over the entire land. In Drontheim the archbishop
and all the canons of the cathedral chapter died, except
a single one, who then alone elected the new
archbishop. In many districts the entire population
was swept away; horses and cattle starved to death,
for want of attendance, or perished in the woods.
The results of the labor of centuries were destroyed.
Where once there had been fertile valleys and animated
human intercourse, the forest grew up unheeded.
The fox barked in the deserted farm-houses,
and the wolf prowled in the empty churches. In
many places the dead lay unburied, until, by the slow
process of dissolution, the earth reclaimed them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
Sloth and indifference took possession of the survivors.
The peasant neglected to till his fields,
because he could procure neither horses nor laborers
to assist him. Famine and death were the result.
All industries stagnated, and what there was left of
Norwegian commerce fell completely into the hands
of foreigners. As is usually the case in the times of
great plagues, when the restraints of social order are
relaxed, vice grew riotous, and every extreme of
lawless passion was wantonly displayed. Centuries
elapsed before the country recovered from the results
of this terrible calamity. But there were other
causes which combined with the pestilence in producing
the political impotence and social barbarism
which followed. There is a danger in doing injustice,
even to the Black Death, and it has, until
recently, been the fashion to make it solely responsible
for the eclipse of Norway's glory.</p>

<p>Olaf, the only son of Haakon Magnusson and
Margaret, was proclaimed King of Norway at his
father's death. Five years earlier he had, after the
death of his maternal grandfather, been elected
king of Denmark. As he was yet a child, his
mother Margaret and the Council of the Regency
conducted the government in his name. Thus commenced
the union of Norway and Denmark, which
lasted without interruption for 434 years, and which
proved so disastrous to the former country. Olaf
died at the age of seventeen at Falsterbro in
Skaane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<h3>NORWAY DURING THE KALMAR UNION.</h3>


<p>Olaf was succeeded both in Denmark and Norway
by his mother, Margaret, who became reigning
queen. The real heir to the Norwegian throne was,
in accordance with the law of succession, the Lord
High Steward (Drost) Haakon Jonsson, a grandson
of Agnes, an illegitimate daughter of Haakon Longlegs.
But he did not possess the power to assert his
claim against Margaret, who, by skilful intriguing,
had induced the archbishop, Vinald, and the majority
of the clergy to take her side. The Norwegian
Council of Regency, in which the partisans of the
queen likewise preponderated, seemed ready to do
any thing which she demanded, and even yielded to
her wish in pledging themselves to choose her grand-nephew,
Erik of Pomerania, as her successor (1388).
In accordance with this promise they declared Erik,
during the following year (1389), king of Norway,
under the guardianship of Margaret, until he should
reach his majority.</p>

<p>The ambitious queen now turned her attention to
Sweden, where she had a bitter and determined foe
in Albrecht of Mecklenburg. He was remotely
related to the royal house of Norway, and therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
believed himself to be the nearest heir to the throne.
He was boiling over with animosity toward Margaret,
whom he called "Queen Breechless," and
never referred to, except with opprobrious epithets.
As this kind of harmless ammunition produced no
effect, however, he boldly assumed the title of king
of Denmark and Norway, and prepared to enforce his
claim. But he had reckoned without his host, when
he supposed that the Swedes would support him in
this enterprise. The Swedish nobility, which possessed
greater power than the king, had long been dissatisfied
with Albrecht, because he had surrounded
himself with Germans, to whom he had given fiefs
and posts of honor. They had long desired to rid
themselves of him, and when Margaret made overtures
to them, they seized the opportunity to accomplish
their purpose. In February, 1389, Albrecht
had to confront a united Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian
army. The battle, fought at Falk&ouml;ping, in
Vesterg&ouml;tland, was fraught with great results. Albrecht,
who was unacquainted with the region, ventured
with his heavy cavalry out upon a frozen
marsh, fell through, and was taken prisoner. Margaret
had him now in her power and determined to
make him pay the penalty for the liberty he had
taken with her name. Instead of the crown of Denmark,
which he had meant to wear, she put upon his
head a fool's cap with a tail 28 feet long, and mocked
him mercilessly. He was then imprisoned in the
castle of Lindholm, in Skaane, where he spent six
years.</p>

<p>After the battle of Falk&ouml;ping Margaret's army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
met with no resistance in the southern provinces;
but Stockholm had to be subjected to a long siege,
during which it suffered greater depredations from
internal than from external foes. Bloody feuds between
two contending parties raged within the city.
A brotherhood of pirates, the so-called Vitalie
Brethren, furnished the citizens with provisions,
thereby delaying their surrender. These pirates had
for the nonce entered into an alliance with Rostock
and Wismar, two cities of Mecklenburg, which sympathized
with the imprisoned Albrecht. In the end
Stockholm was forced to open its gates to Queen
Margaret, in accordance with a compromise which
was concluded in 1395. Albrecht was to pay a ransom
of sixty thousand marks, and in case of his
failure to provide this sum, within three years, he
should either return to his prison or surrender Stockholm.
He chose to do the latter.</p>

<p>Margaret had now reached the goal of her desires.
She was the ruler of the whole Scandinavian race.
She might have placed the triple crown upon her
head, but preferred to secure this proud prize to her
nephew, Erik of Pomerania, by having him crowned
while she was yet alive. To this end she summoned
representatives of the three kingdoms to a meeting
in Kalmar, where a draft was made for a constitution,
upon which the union was to be based.
Although the document was signed by the Norwegian,
Swedish, and Danish magnates present, it
was scarcely legally binding upon their countrymen.
It bears the date of July 20, 1397, and contains the
following stipulations:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The three kingdoms were to be eternally united
under one king.</p>

<p>2. If the king died without issue, the magnates of
the three kingdoms should come together and peaceably
elect a successor.</p>

<p>3. Each kingdom should be governed in accordance
with its own laws and customs; but if one of
the kingdoms was attacked, the two others should,
in good faith, assist in its defence.</p>

<p>4. The king and his councillors from the three
kingdoms should have the right to enter into foreign
alliances, and whatever they agreed upon should be
binding upon the three countries.</p>

<p>This was the famous Kalmar Union, which might
have been a blessing to the brother kingdoms, but
which to two of them, at least, became a curse. At
first sight, it seemed a rational arrangement which
promised success. The three nations were so closely
akin, that they understood without effort each other's
languages, which were but slight modifications of
the same original tongue. If the forces which
had been wasted in mutual wars and rivalries could
have been combined for mutual help and common
purposes, the kingdom of Scandinavia would have
risen in prosperity and strength and would have
taken a place among the European powers. Under
a wise and far-sighted policy, the society of the
three kingdoms could have been gradually amalgamated,
its similarities and common interests emphasized,
its differences slowly obliterated. If the
kings of the Union had had the slightest conception
of the task that was presented to them, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
been capable of viewing themselves apart from their
Danish nationality, such results might have been
achieved. But they were, with a single exception,
utterly destitute of political ability and foresight.
They were determined to raise the Danish to the
position of a dominant nationality and to reduce
Norway and Sweden to a provincial relation. Hereby
they aroused again the ancient jealousies. They
sent a troop of Danish and German nobles to prey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
upon the latter countries, which they seemed to
regard as conquered territory. The Swedes complained
of their being obliged to pay taxes, in order
to defray the expenses of Danish wars, and they
were vehement in their denunciation of the extortion
of the Danish officials who plundered their provinces
like Roman proconsuls.</p>

<span class="caption">QUEEN MARGARET.</span>
</div>

<p>The Norwegians were preliminarily disposed to be
more patient, chiefly because they lacked spokesmen,
the remnants of their old nobility being too powerless
to assert themselves against the Danes. Nor
can it be said that, during Queen Margaret's life, the
conditions were intolerable. She died, however, in
Flensborg (1412) aged 59 years, leaving her wide
dominions in the feeble hands of Erik of Pomerania.</p>

<p>Erik had inherited from Margaret a war with the
dukes of Sleswick, which lasted for twenty-five years,
exhausting the resources of his realm and completely
revealing his incapacity for government. The Swedes
grumbled at the taxation which the war necessitated,
and rebelled under the leadership of Engelbrekt
Engelbrektsson. A Danish prefect, J&ouml;sse Eriksson,
had been guilty of great cruelty to the peasants in
Dalarne, taking their horses and oxen from the plow,
hitching their pregnant wives to hay-loads, and horribly
maiming all who dared to complain. Engelbrekt
went twice to Denmark and asked the king to
remove this malefactor, but was the first time put
off with promises and the second time bluntly rebuffed.
He then placed himself at the head of a
rebellion, which spread from Dalarne over the whole
kingdom. In Norway a similar, though less for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>midable,
revolt broke out under Amund Sigurdsson
Bolt (1436), who likewise sought to obtain redress
against the Danish magistrates. The king, however,
who saw his advantage in allowing considerable latitude
to his creatures, wearied of the eternal complaints,
and, carrying with him whatever money was
left in the treasury, took up his residence in a fortified
castle on the island of Gottland (1438). He was
now formally deposed both in Denmark and Sweden,
while in Norway the regent, or governor, Sigurd
Jonsson, continued for a while to conduct the government
in his name. When it became generally
known, however, that the king had become a pirate,
the Norwegians, too, revoked their allegiance (1442).
For ten years Erik lived in his castle in Gottland,
supporting himself by piracy, but was finally driven
away. He then returned to Pomerania, where he
died in 1459.</p>

<p>During the reign of this unworthy king, the city
of Bergen was twice sacked and partly burned by the
Vitalie Brethren, who murdered the citizens, plundered
the churches and the episcopal residence, and
carried away a rich booty.</p>

<p>With the tenacious fidelity peculiar to their race,
the Norwegians adhered to the cause of Erik, even
after he himself had abandoned it. They had, however,
no choice but to recognize as his successor his
nephew, Christopher of Bavaria, who had already
been proclaimed king in Denmark and Sweden.
In the latter country Charles Knutsson Peasant
(Bonde), who, after the murder of Engelbrekt, had
become the leader of the rebellion, and later regent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
had vainly endeavored to break the Union. The
clergy made common cause with Christopher, and
were instrumental in securing his election.</p>

<p>Christopher was a jolly and good-natured man, who
had no aptitude for affairs of state. When the
Swedes complained of the piracy of Erik of Pomerania,
he answered merrily: "Our uncle is sitting on
a rock; he, too, must earn his living."</p>

<p>He deserves, however, as far as Norway was concerned,
the credit of good intentions. He made an
effort, though a futile one, to deprive the Hanseatic
cities of their monopoly of trade, by giving equal
privileges to the citizens of Amsterdam. The League
was then less formidable than it had been, owing to
the successful rivalry of the Dutch in other markets.
It is difficult to say what the issue of the struggle
would have been, if Christopher had lived. Death
overtook him in 1448, when he was but thirty-two
years old.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3>THE UNION WITH DENMARK.</h3>


<p>It has been said that, during the union with Denmark,
Norway had no history, and this is partly true.
The history of the Oldenborg kings, with their wars,
and court intrigues and mistresses, is in no sense the
history of Norway. Nor was the social development
of Norway parallel with that of Denmark, during the
reign of these kings. Though oppressed and politically
powerless, the remoter kingdom escaped the
utter misery and degradation which overtook its oppressor.
The Danish nobility, though, like hungry
wolves, they consumed the people's substance, did
not succeed in reducing the Norse peasantry to serfdom,
as they did their own. The so-called <i>Vornedskab</i><a name="FNanchor_A_68" id="FNanchor_A_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_68" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
in Denmark was but another name for serfdom.
The nobles, who held the land, in a hundred ways
oppressed and maltreated their peasants; they could
sell, though they were not at liberty to kill them.
Denmark, being an elective and not an hereditary
kingdom, afforded the nobility opportunities for continually
strengthening their position, by exacting an
increase of their privileges of each candidate for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
throne, before consenting to elect him. This contract
or charter granted by the kings to the nobles
(<i>Haandfestning</i>) became a terrible instrument for the
oppression of those estates which were either unrepresented
or without influence in the Royal Council.
From having been a body, subordinate to the king,
the council gradually became co-ordinate with him,
and at last his superior. From this state of things
it followed that the king needed some counterbalancing
support against its overweening influence, and
this support he sought in Norway. Here the election
was a mere form, the succession being based upon
hereditary right. The king could, if he was minded
to redress the grievances of the people, rely upon
their loyalty. Even if he was deaf to their complaints,
they were disposed to excuse him, and hold
his councillors responsible for his shortcomings. But,
as a rule, the kings of the house of Oldenborg did
pay more attention to the complaints of their Norse
subjects than to those of their own, and they did
this&mdash;first, because it was important to them to preserve
the loyalty of the Norsemen; secondly, because
the Norsemen, if their petitions were unheeded, stood
ready to take up arms. They knew their rights from
of old, and a continued infringement of them, on the
part of the foreign officials, made sooner or later the
war-arrow fly from farm to farm; and the king was
confronted with an armed rebellion. Again and again
the obnoxious magistrates, who had imagined that
these sturdy mountaineers were as meek and long-suffering
as their Danish brethren, were mercilessly
beaten, maimed, or killed. Repeatedly the govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>ment
was forced to concede to rebels what they had
not yielded to supplicants. Unpopular laws were
revoked, oppressive burdens removed, and promises
made of improved administration.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_68" id="Footnote_A_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_68"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Prof. J. E. Sars: "Norge under Foreningen med Danmark."
Nordisk Universitets-Tidskrift for 1858 and 1861.</p></div>

<p>And yet, in spite of these ameliorating circumstances,
Norway's condition during the Danish rule
was miserable. The revenues of the country were
spent in Copenhagen, and the people were heavily
taxed to support a foreign court and a hungry brood
of foreign officials, whose chief interest was to fill their
own pockets. Danish nobles married into the great
Norwegian families, and secured, by bribery and intrigue
in Copenhagen, a virtual franchise for unlimited
ill-doing. Great estates were accumulated in the
hands of men like Vincentz Lunge, Hartvig Krummedike,
and Hannibal Sehested, and the courts were
prostituted to favor the land-grabbing schemes of
noble adventurers. The public spirit which, in times
of old, had jealously watched over the interests of the
realm, had already been weakened by the incipient
despotism of the last national kings; and what
there was left of it now gradually expired. A most
striking proof of this is the fact that when, in 1537,
Norway lost the last vestige of her independence,
being declared to be a province of Denmark, the
decree was accepted without protest, and caused no
perceptible excitement. So gradually had the change
taken place, that no one was surprised. The same
peasants who boldly resented any encroachment upon
their personal rights and killed the magistrate who
overtaxed them, heard without a murmur of the extinction
of their nationality. It has been surmised,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
as a cause of their lethargy, that they did not hear of
it&mdash;at least, not simultaneously, but gradually and
casually, in the course of years; and it is not improbable
that the imperfect means of communication
was responsible for their apparent acquiescence.</p>

<p>No attempt will be made in the following pages
to relate the history of Denmark, except in so far as
it directly affected that of Norway, and the plan of
the present work excludes any but the most general
characterization of the social conditions. The story
of the Union will, therefore, be disproportionately
short.</p>

<p>The death of Christopher of Bavaria afforded the
Swedes an opportunity to assert again their independence.
The common hatred of the Danes enabled
the hostile estates to forget their differences
and to unite in electing Charles Knutsson Peasant
king of Sweden. The Norsemen had a candidate
for the throne of Norway in the regent, Sigurd
Jonsson, a descendant of Agnes, the daughter of
Haakon Longlegs, but they failed to support him.
One party desired to make common cause with Sweden
and elect Charles Knutsson, while another favored
Count Christian of Oldenborg, who had just
been elected in Denmark. This latter party,
supported by the Danish nobles, who already
wielded a great influence, was victorious. King
Christian I. (1450-1481) arrived in Norway in the
summer of 1450, and was crowned in the cathedral
of Drontheim. At a meeting of the Council of Regency
in Bergen, it was resolved that Norway was to
remain eternally united with Denmark under one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
king, but that each kingdom should be free and the
other's equal, and should be governed in accordance
with its own laws and by native-born officials.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus507.jpg" width="302" height="500" alt="Christianus. I. Rex Dani&aelig;." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">Christianus. I. Rex Dani&aelig;.</span>
</div>

<p>Christian could not give up the thought of re&euml;stablishing
the Kalmar Union, and he therefore
waged war for several years with King Charles
Knutsson. In 1452 the latter invaded Norway
and conquered Drontheim, but the commandant
in Bergen, Sir Olaf Nilsson, again drove him back
across the frontier. Soon internal dissensions in
Sweden enabled Christian to defeat Charles and
expel him from his country (1457); and, in 1458,
the three kingdoms were thus again united. Christian's
extortions and shameless breaches of faith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
made him, however, soon so detested both among
peasants and nobles, that a rebellion broke out;
Charles was recalled, and, though he did not at
once become master of the situation, he succeeded
in keeping the Danes at bay. He died as King of
Sweden in 1470. When Christian during the following
year made an attempt to conquer Sweden,
he was overwhelmingly beaten at Brunkeberg near
Stockholm by the regent, Steen Sture the Elder.</p>

<p>In Norway Christian broke his promises with the
same cynical disregard as he did in Sweden. Instead
of appointing native officials, he allowed the Danish
nobles to plunder as of old, and made no effort to
discipline them. The German merchants in Bergen
also became constantly more insolent in their behavior
toward the citizens, whom they drove away
from the wharves and treated like conquered people;
but Christian did not dare to restrain them in their
violations of law and order, because he feared that
the Hansa might avenge itself by interfering in his
war with Sweden. Even when the Germans murdered
Sir Olaf Nilsson, his friend, Bishop Thorleif,
and sixty other citizens, and burned the cloister
of Munkeliv, the king refrained from punishing
them.</p>

<p>Highly characteristic of the way the Danish kings
regarded Norway was Christian's transaction with
James III. of Scotland. A marriage was arranged
with the latter and Christian's daughter Margaret,
and the dower was fixed at 60,000 g&uuml;lden. As the
Danish king was unable to pay this amount, he remitted
the tribute due from Scotland for the He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>brides,
pawned the Orkneys for 50,000 g&uuml;lden and
the Shetland Isles for an additional amount. Thus
Norway lost these ancient dependencies; for it is
needless to say that they were never redeemed.</p>

<p>Christian I. was succeeded by his son Hans or Johannes
(1483-1513). The Norsemen, who had now
had a sufficient taste of Danish rule, were not
anxious to be governed by him, and a rebellion
broke out, which, however, was short-lived. The
Danish nobles, who, by marrying Norwegian women,
could obtain citizenship, had by this time secured a
preponderating power in the Council of Regency, and
had small difficulty in getting their king acknowledged.
The Swedes resisted until the year 1497,
when Hans defeated Steen Sture's army and was declared
king of Sweden. Three years later, however, he
suffered a terrible defeat in Ditmarsken (1500), whose
inhabitants opened the dikes and called in the ocean
as their ally. Four thousand Danes were here slain
or drowned, and enormous treasures were lost. This
was the signal for renewed risings both in Sweden
and in Norway. The Norse knight, Sir Knut Alfsson,
of Giske, who derived his descent from the old
royal house, united with the Swedes and defeated
Duke Christian, the king's son, in Vesterg&ouml;tland.
Then he invaded Norway and captured the fortresses
Tunsberghus and Akershus; but was besieged in the
latter place by the Danes under Henrik Krummedike.
Seeing small chance of taking the fortress,
the Danish general invited Sir Knut to a conference,
under safe-conduct, but foully slew him and threw
his body into the water. The wretched king appa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>rently
approved of this treason, for instead of punishing
Sir Henrik, he heaped honors upon him, and
declared the great possessions of the murdered man
to be forfeited to the crown.</p>

<p>Once more the Norsemen attempted to throw off
the detested Danish yoke (1508), under the leadership
of the peasant Herluf Hyttefad, but the country
was already too divided between the foreign and the
native interest to afford sufficient support for a successful
rising. Duke Christian came with a Danish
army and quelled the rebellion, and executed its
leaders. He did not, however, satisfy himself with
this. He was a believer in radical measures. In
order to break the rebellious temper of the Norsemen,
once for all, he captured and murdered as many
of the representatives of the great Norse families, as
he could lay hold of. With atrocious cruelty he
raged in Norway until every trace of the rebellion
seemed extinct.</p>

<p>The Swedes were more fortunate in their resistance
to this blood-thirsty tyrant. After the death
of Steen Sture the Elder (1503), they elected Svante
Nilsson Sture regent, and after his death, his son,
Steen Sture the Younger. These brave and patriotic
men conducted the government with wisdom and
energy, and succeeded in maintaining themselves
against the power of the Danes during the remainder
of the reign of King Hans.</p>

<p>Christian II. (1513-1523, d. 1559), was forced, on
mounting the throne, to grant a charter to the nobility,
which nearly deprived him of all power. The
rule of the nobles had by this time become so great a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
curse, both in Denmark and Norway, that any measure
for its curtailment seemed justifiable. Their principle
of government was that of hawks in a poultry-yard.
Whatever the citizens undertook for their advancement
was checked by the interference of the privileged
classes; commerce and industry were discouraged,
lest the bourgeoisie should gain power enough
to assert itself. The peasantry were given absolutely
into the barons' power, and their degradation was
made complete by the so-called "right of neck and
hand," which Christian II. granted as the price of
his crown. By this concession the nobles acquired
the right to sentence and punish their peasants at
their own discretion, without the intercession of the
courts. The king, however, felt the humiliation of
this concession scarcely less than its victims. He
determined to prepare himself for a life and death
struggle with the nobility; and with this in view
strove to increase his power. He secured foreign
alliances and married the wealthiest princess in
Europe, Isabella, sister of the German Emperor
Charles V. In order to reach that summit of power
from which he should be able to crush the refractory
magnates he deemed it important to regain the
crown of Sweden, and at Bogesund he defeated Steen
Sture the Younger, who fell in the battle (1520).
The latter had had a bitter enemy in the wily archbishop,
Gustavus Trolle, who made common cause
with Christian, and crowned him king of Sweden.
The archbishop thought this a good chance to
avenge himself upon his enemies, of Steen Sture's
party, and at his instigation Christian executed fifty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
of the most eminent men in Sweden, among whom
were two bishops, thirteen members of the Council
of Regency, and many brave citizens.</p>

<p>This was the notorious Carnage of Stockholm.
Secure in the thought that the Swedes were now
cowed into submission, Christian II. returned to
Denmark; but his dastardly deed had an unforeseen
effect. A young nobleman, Gustavus Eriksson Wasa,
whose father had been beheaded and who had himself
been captured by Christian, escaped from his
prison and became the deliverer of his country.
The common indignation against the tyrant united
once more all warring factions; the Danes were
everywhere defeated, and Gustavus Wasa became
first, regent, and later, king of Sweden (1523). From
that time forth, the power of the Danes in Sweden
was at an end.</p>

<p>The failure of his plans abroad discredited Christian
II. at home. His overweening self-esteem and
impetuosity led him to commit rash acts, whereby he
gave his enemies an advantage. Also in inaugurating
reforms, which would have been beneficial, if they
could have been carried into effect, he failed to measure
the strength of the opposition which he would
be sure to encounter. He issued a decree abolishing
serfdom, encouraged commerce and industry, and
hoped in the impending struggle to find support
among the bourgeoisie and peasants, whose gratitude
he had earned. Nor did he in this respect deceive
himself. But long oppression had made the people
timid, and their support was largely passive, and
could not, without energetic leaders, be made to as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>sert
itself. The upper estates were yet too powerful.
Christian had, by his devotion to Luther's teachings,
also added the clergy to the number of his enemies,
and by his championship of Dutch and native commerce
he had incensed the Hansa. His uncle, Duke
Frederick, of Holstein, took advantage of his many
blunders, made alluring promises to the nobility,
allied himself with the Hansa and began a war
against his nephew. Christian summoned an assembly
of notables to meet him at Viborg, but the nobles
of Jutland, fearing that he might repeat the Carnage
of Stockholm, sent him a letter, revoking their allegiance.
Christian lost his courage, and instead of
summoning the citizens to his support gathered all
his treasures and fled to Holland (1523).</p>

<p>Duke Frederick, of Holstein, now ascended the
throne under the name of Frederick I. (1524-1533),
and by the aid of the Danish nobleman, Vincentz
Lunge, soon succeeded in gaining Norway. Sir Vincentz,
who was a highly-cultivated but rapacious and
unscrupulous man, had married the daughter of the
Norse knight, Sir Nils Henriksson, whose wife, Inger
Ottesdatter, was related to the old royal house. This
remarkable woman, commonly known as Mistress
Inger of Oestraat, played a prominent r&ocirc;le in her
day, but, unhappily, threw the weight of her wealth
and influence on the side of the oppressors. One of
her daughters married the Danish nobleman Erik
Ugerup, another Nils Lykke, and a fourth was betrothed
by her ambitious mother to a Swedish impostor
who pretended to be a son of Steen Sture
and a candidate for the Swedish throne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctrines of Luther were at that time being
zealously preached in Sweden and Denmark, and
were favored by the king and the greater portion of
the nobility. In Norway there was no effort made
to introduce the Reformation, and the people there
remained devoted to the Catholic faith. Christian
II. saw in this circumstance a chance of regaining his
lost throne. He had previously inclined toward Luther,
but he now declared himself the champion of
the old faith, arrived in Norway with a fleet (1531),
and gained a large number of adherents. But the
same incapacity and imprudence, which had wrecked
his fortunes before, again precipitated his downfall.
In the critical moment, when resolution and courage
were required, Christian, as usual, showed himself a
poltroon. When the fortress of Akershus, which he
was besieging, was relieved by the L&uuml;beckers, and a
Danish fleet arrived under the command of Knut
Gyldenstjerne, he began to despair and finally betook
himself to Denmark under safe-conduct, in order to
negotiate with his uncle. On arriving there he was
unceremoniously thrown into prison. Frederick I.,
although he had pledged his royal honor, at the request
of the nobility, broke his promise and Christian
was held a prisoner until the day of his death
(1559).</p>

<p>The Norsemen were severely punished for their
alliance with the deposed king, although Frederick
I. had promised them immunity, on condition of
their returning to their allegiance.</p>

<p>At the death of Frederick I. an interregnum of
four years occurred (1533-1537), before a successor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
was chosen. It was the religious question which
had divided Denmark into two hostile camps.
Christian, the oldest son of the late king, was devoted
to Protestantism, while Hans, the younger, had been
brought up in the Catholic faith. The nobles,
accordingly, favored the former, and the clergy the
latter, while the lower estates desired to reinstate
Christian II. in the possession of his throne. In
Norway there were but two parties, one headed by
Vincentz Lunge, favoring Duke Christian, and a
Catholic party, which pinned its hopes upon the
imprisoned king. A sudden show of strength was
imparted to the latter's faction, when the L&uuml;beckers
took up his cause, and their general, Count
Christopher of Oldenborg, invaded Denmark, and
gave the peasantry a chance to avenge themselves
upon their oppressors. This opportunity was eagerly
embraced; castles were sacked and destroyed, noblemen
murdered, and the wildest atrocities committed.
For a while civil war raged in Denmark with all its
horrors, and in the presence of this calamity the
opposing parties buried their differences and elected
Christian III. king (1537-1559). By the aid of King
Gustavus in Sweden he succeeded in defeating and
expelling Count Christopher, after whom this war is
called the Count's Feud. The Norwegians were not
disposed to recognize the validity of King Christian's
election, concerning which they had not been consulted;
and when, after the capitulation of Count
Christopher, the cause of Christian II. seemed hopelessly
lost, they declared in favor of his son-in-law,
Count Palatine Frederick, whose candidacy was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
supported by the German Emperor. The Danish
nobles, headed by Vincentz Lunge, were, of course,
adherents of Christian III., while the archbishop,
Olaf Engelbrektsson, was the leader of the opposition.
At a meeting in Bergen, called for the purpose
of electing a king, the people grew furious at the
sight of the Danish magnates, attacked them and
murdered Sir Vincentz Lunge. Many others were
imprisoned and otherwise maltreated. If the Count
Palatine had now arrived in Norway and supported
his adherents, there might have been a chance of his
success. But unhappily he lacked money and was
not effectually aided by the emperor. The archbishop
had therefore no choice but to offer his allegiance
to Christian III. on condition of his respecting
the ancient liberties of the land. But the Danish
King, though he seemingly acquiesced, had no intention
of granting such easy terms. He sailed to Norway
with his fleet (1537), and although he met with
no opposition, he seemed to think that he had conquered
the country and had the right to do with it
as he chose. He abolished the Norwegian Council
of Regency and henceforth administered the government
through a viceroy and a chancellor, both of
whom were Danes. The last vestige of Norwegian
independence was thus lost, and Norway became a
province of Denmark.</p>

<p>Archbishop Olaf, without awaiting the king's
arrival, fled to Holland, taking with him the treasures
of the cathedral, and died in exile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h3>NORWAY AS A PROVINCE OF DENMARK
(1537-1814).</h3>


<p>During the reign of Christian III. the Lutheran
faith was introduced into Denmark, and its introduction
into Norway followed as a matter of course.
The new Danish ecclesiastical law, called the Ordinance,
was also made to apply to the provinces. The
landed estates which had belonged to the Church
were confiscated by the crown or distributed among
royal favorites. In fact, the plunder of churches
and monasteries was the only evidence of religious
zeal which the Danes exhibited in Norway. The
Catholic bishops were removed; but many of
the priests were allowed to remain, as Lutheran pastors
were hard to obtain and were needed at home.
Gradually, however, the change took place; and
everywhere aroused discontent among the peasantry.
Many parishes were left, for long periods, without any
kind of religious teaching, and when Lutheran pastors
were sent up from Denmark, they were usually ignorant
or vicious men who could not be used at home.
Ex-soldiers, ex-sailors, bankrupt traders, and all sorts
of vagabonds, who were in some way disqualified for
making a living, were thought to be good enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
preach the word of God in Norway. The majority
of them were utterly destitute of theological training,
and it is said that there were some who could not even
read. No one, then, ought to wonder at the reception
they received from their parishioners. Some of them
were killed, others driven away and horribly beaten.
At last physical strength became the prime requisite
for holding a pastorate in the Norse mountain valleys,
and the surest road to popularity for a parson
was to thrash the refractory members of his congregation.
That inspired respect and inclined the rest
more favorably toward his preaching. Great credit
deserves the first Lutheran bishop in Bergen, Gjeble
Pedersson, for his efforts to educate a native Protestant
clergy. The Danish language, however, remained
the language of the Norwegian church; all
religious instruction was imparted in it, and at the
present day, all who lay claim to culture in Norway
speak Danish.</p>

<p>The depredations committed by the Danish nobles,
during the reign of Christian III., defy description.
It was the darkest period in the history of Norway,
and, as far as the people were concerned, very nearly
the darkest, too, in the history of Denmark. The
power of the nobles reached such a height that the
king himself was merely the tool of their will and was
used by them, as an instrument for the most cruel
and heartless oppression.</p>

<p>The discomfiture of the L&uuml;beckers in the Count's
Feud was the first serious check which the Hansa
received in the North, and it never regained its former
power. The Danish nobleman, Christopher Valkendorf,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
who was governor (<i>Lensherre</i>) in Bergen, succeeded
in destroying the monopoly of the Germans

native merchants.</p>

<p>Christian III. was succeeded by his son Frederick
II. (1559-1588), a vain and worthless man, whose fondness
for drink shortened his life. He waged a long and
costly war with Sweden about the right to carry the
Swedish "three crowns" in the Danish coat-of-arms.
The Norwegians, although their sympathies were at
the outset with the Swedes, suffered greatly from the
inroads of hostile armies, which burned cities and
ravaged the land. Sweden, regarding Norway
merely as a Danish province, thought to injure its
foe, by destroying whatever belonged to him or
acknowledged his sway. Thus the cathedral of
Hamar was burned; the fertile districts of Aker were
harried, and the city of Drontheim was taken. The
Danes burned Oslo in order to prevent it from falling
into the hands of the Swedes.</p>

<p>Two Danish governors, Ludwig and Erik Munk,
became notorious for their unheard of cruelties and
extortions. The peasants sent repeated complaints
to the king and threatened rebellion. At last
Erik Munk was sentenced to return all taxes which
he had illegally collected, and to restore to a peasant
his property, of which he had unlawfully taken possession.
Later he was deprived of his office, and
committed suicide while in prison.</p>

<p>The city of Frederickstad, which was forced into
existence, after the burning of the ancient Sarpsborg,
bears the name of Frederick II.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian IV. (1588-1648) had not inherited his
father's infirmities. He was a man of many excellent
qualities; desirous of furthering the welfare of
his subjects, but crippled in his efforts by the opposition
of the arrogant nobility. What particularly
deserves notice was his good disposition toward the
Norsemen. Unlike his predecessors, he paid frequent
visits to their country, once even penetrating within
the Arctic Circle. He listened to the complaints of
the people, and punished with fines and imprisonment
the Danish officials who ventured to exceed
their rights. The old law of Magnus Law-Mender
which, on account of the change of the language,
was now hard to comprehend, he abolished, and
elaborated, in its stead, a Norse law, some regulations
of which are yet in force. Also the ecclesiastical
law or Ordinance was altered and adapted to the
needs of the country. The present capital of Norway,
Christiania, was founded by him, as also the
city of Christiansand. The discovery of silver at
Kongsberg, and of copper at R&ouml;raas, gave an impetus
to the mining industries of the country, and
thereby started the growth of two small towns.</p>

<p>By his kindness, his love of justice, and his interest
in their affairs, Christian IV. won the hearts of
the Norsemen, as no king of the house of Oldenborg,
before or since. Sometimes he dropped in at a
peasant's wedding, and drank the health of the bride;
watched the games upon the German wharf in Bergen,
and attended a party at the apothecary's where the
jolly guests smashed all the windows. He had a
pair of eyes which nothing escaped; and an active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
and alert mind which turned his observations to good
account. All economical questions interested him;
whatever he undertook, he supervised with the most
minute care every detail of its execution. With level
and square in his pocket he walked about testing the
soundness of the work of his carpenters, masons, and
architects.</p>

<p>Three great wars, two of which concerned Norway,
disturbed the reign of Christian IV. The first, the
so-called Kalmar War (1511-1513), occasioned an
invasion of Scotch mercenaries hired by the king of
Sweden. These came, however, to grief at Kringen
in Guldbrandsdale, where the peasants attacked
them, and at the first shot killed their commander,
Colonel Sinclair. Of the entire force, numbering
nine hundred, not one man, it is said, escaped. More
fortunate was Colonel M&ouml;nnikhofen, who landed with
eight hundred Dutch mercenaries in S&ouml;ndm&ouml;re, and
made his way, ravaging and plundering, across the
frontier. The cause of this war was the assumption,
on the part of the Swedish king, Charles IX., of the title
of King of the Lapps, and his claim to the Norwegian
province of Finmark. Charles died during the hostilities,
and his son Gustavus Adolphus made peace
at Knaer&ouml;d, abandoning both the claim and the
title.</p>

<p>The participation of Christian IV. in the Thirty
Years' War, as the ally of the oppressed German
Protestants, brought him no glory. After his defeat
by Tilly at Lutter and Barenberge, the imperial
armies overran Sleswick and Jutland, and at the Peace
of L&uuml;beck (1629), Christian had to promise never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>more
to meddle in German politics. After this
humiliation, he could not see, without alarm, the
progress of the Swedes in Germany; and could not
refrain from placing obstacles in their way. The
war was being continued, after the death of Gustavus
Adolphus, by able generals and diplomats, who
resolved to anticipate the Danish king in his efforts
to thwart them. Before Christian suspected that
his intentions were revealed, General Torstenson
crossed the southern frontier, invaded Holstein, and
advanced into Jutland (1643). The Danes were
utterly unable to resist the conquering host, and
though they hotly contested two naval battles, their
inability to cope with the Swedes soon became apparent.
Peace was, therefore, concluded at Br&ouml;msebro;
and Norway was made to pay the costs of
Danish incapacity and miscalculation. The two
great Norse provinces Jemteland and Herjedale
were ceded to Sweden; as also the island of Gottland,
which had latterly belonged to Denmark
(1647).</p>

<p>In Norway this war was named Hannibal's Feud,
after the viceroy Hannibal Sehested, a son-in-law of
the king, who, with the aid of the brave parson,
Kjeld Stub, guarded the frontier.</p>

<p>One might have supposed that the nobles, at the
death of Christian IV. would have rested content
with the excessive privileges which they already
possessed, and allowed his son Frederick III. (1648-1670)
to ascend the throne, without stripping himself
of the last remnant of his power. But as long
as there was any thing left to grab, it seemed worth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
grabbing. Frederick III. was, therefore, compelled
to grant a more humiliating charter than any of his
predecessors, and would have been, if he had long
acquiesced in the agreement, a mere shadow king.
The arrogance and greed of the nobles, fostered by
long security in aggression, became, however, the
cause of their downfall. The Royal Council, which
was the real governing power in the state, had the
imprudence to declare war against Sweden, on the
strength of a rumor, that the Swedish king, Charles
X. Gustavus, had suffered an overwhelming defeat
in Poland. This rumor proved to be false, and
Charles conquered in a short time both Jutland and
Funen, and threatened Copenhagen. Denmark was
completely at his mercy, and the Council was compelled
to buy peace at Roskilde (1658) by the cession
of Skaane, Halland, Blekinge, Bornholm, and
the Norwegian provinces, Viken and Drontheim.
And yet in Norway the only success of the war had
been won, the Norwegian general Bjelke having conquered
Jemteland. It seemed as if Charles Gustavus,
after having obtained these enormous advantages,
regretted that he had not made an end of Denmark
altogether. He hesitated to quit Danish territory,
renewed the war, and was, by aid of the Dutch and
Austrians, who feared his overweening power, defeated
at Nyborg and repulsed at Copenhagen. In
Norway the Tr&ouml;nders revolted successfully against
the Swedish rule, and the Bornholmers likewise
drove away the invaders. At the Peace of Copenhagen
(1660), Charles Gustavus was forced to relinquish
his hold upon these provinces, while keeping his
other conquests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>It was plain that it was chiefly the nobles composing
the Royal Council who were responsible for
the degradation which these wars had brought upon
Denmark. And yet, although they were in possession
of great wealth, gained by pillaging the lower
estates, they refused to bear any share of the public
burdens. The condition of the country was now so
desperate and the misery so great that but a breath
was needed to kindle the smouldering indignation
into flame. The public debt had reached an enormous
amount, and there was no prospect of paying
it without increased taxation. The king then summoned
a diet to meet him at Copenhagen, and invited
representatives of the clergy and the bourgeoisie
to participate in its deliberations. These
entered into an alliance with him against the nobles,
and the latter, fearing an outbreak of violence, did
not at first dare offer any resistance. When they
picked up their courage again, the citizens of Copenhagen
locked the gates and compelled them to come
to terms. It was then resolved that Denmark should
henceforth be an hereditary kingdom, and that the
Royal Council should be abolished. All fiefs were
revoked and a new system of administration was
introduced, with royal officials, responsible to the
king. It was agreed that a constitution should be
adopted, and its elaboration was, very unwisely, entrusted
to the king. Frederick III. was thus master
of the situation, and as the matter seemed to have
been left to his discretion, he preferred to rule without
any constitution. The so-called Royal Law, which
he endeavored to pass off as such, was rather in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>tended
to make his power secure, than to subject it
to limitations. Thus absolutism pure and simple was
introduced into Denmark (1660). The Danes had
jumped from the frying-pan into the fire; and yet,
though their condition was not enviable, there was a
relief in having one master instead of many.</p>

<p>In Norway the effects of absolutism were chiefly
perceptible in placing the country more nearly upon
an equal footing with Denmark, and in producing a
somewhat improved administration. The nobles
continued to hold many lucrative offices, but the
king was able to exercise a more restraining influence
over them now that his authority was absolute. The
fiefs were changed into counties (<i>amter</i>) and administered
by royal officials with well-defined functions.
A chance was presented to citizens to rise in the service
of the state, and was improved by several able
Norsemen, among whom the naval hero, Kort Adeler,
was pre&euml;minent. After an honorable career in Dutch
and Venetian service, against the Turks, he was made
admiral in the Danish Navy, and greatly increased its
efficiency.</p>

<p>Frederick III. visited Norway but once. The city
of Frederickshald bears his name.</p>

<p>Although the royal revenues had been quintupled
by the revocation of the fiefs, Frederick's son, Christian
V. (1670-1699), was always in want of money.
He spent his time in all sorts of costly amusements,
hoping to rival the splendor of the French king,
Louis XIV., whom he had taken for his model. In
order to counteract the influence of the old Danish
nobility, which, on account of its wealth, was yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
formidable, Christian V. created a new court nobility
of counts and barons, most of whom were Germans.
German became the language of the court, and lands
and lucrative offices were given away to German
favorites. In order to procure money wherewith to
imitate the glittering vices of Versailles, Christian
V. sold his subjects, both Norwegians and Danes, as
mercenaries for foreign service. He had an able adviser
in his chancellor, Griffenfeld, who rose from
poverty to the highest position, in order as suddenly
to be plunged into misery. His enemies aroused the
fickle king's suspicions as to his loyalty; and he was
condemned to death, but his sentence, on the scaffold,
was commuted to imprisonment for life. "Oh
mercy more cruel than death," he exclaimed. Toward
the end of his life he was, however, pardoned.</p>

<p>Christian V. had a new code of laws elaborated for
Norway, which is yet partly in force. He waged a
futile war with Sweden which cost blood and treasure,
but brought no advantage to either of the combatants.</p>

<p>Frederick IV. (1699-1730) ascended the throne
like his father, by right of inheritance, but did not
in other respects follow in his footsteps. He was a
shrewd, but ignorant man; penurious, industrious,
and heartless. By his feud with the Duke of Holstein,
he came into collision with the latter's brother-in-law,
Charles XII., of Sweden, and after a brief and
unsuccessful campaign, made peace on unfavorable
terms at Travendal (1700). When, however, Charles
XII., in 1709, lost the battle of Pultawa, in Russia,
Frederick thought his opportunity had come for re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>gaining
what he had lost; wherefore he entered into
an alliance with Russia and Poland and began the
Great Northern War (1709-1720). Sixteen thousand
Danish troops invaded Skaane, but were beaten by
the Swedish general, Magnus Stenbock (1710). In
the naval battle of Kj&ouml;gebugt, the Norseman, Ivar
Hvitfeldt, who commanded the ship Dannebrog, made
a valiant attack upon the Swedish fleet. His ship,
however, took fire, and although he might have
saved himself by beaching it, such a course would
have endangered the rest of the Danish fleet, which
lay nearer shore. Hvitfeldt, therefore stayed where
he was, sending volley after volley against the Swedes,
while death was staring him in the face. When the
fire reached the powder magazine, he, with five hundred
men, was blown into the air.</p>

<p>On his return to Sweden in 1715 Charles attempted
to conquer Norway and penetrated by
three different routes into the country. He himself
commanded the division which entered H&ouml;land
(1716). The Norwegian Colonel Kruse met him
with 200 men, who fought with such heroism, that
Charles, brave as he was himself, was filled with
admiration.</p>

<p>"Has my brother, King Frederick, many such
officers as thou?" he asked the colonel, as he lay
wounded at his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Kruse, "he has plenty of
them, and I am far from being among the ablest."</p>

<p>In his blindness, Frederick had, in order to raise
money, hired out a large number of the country's
defenders as mercenaries, leaving only a wretched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
little, half-naked and half-starved force of 6,000 men
under General L&uuml;tzow. Charles with his well-drilled
troops expected to make short work of such paltry
opponents. But he failed to take account of the
Norsemen's temper. Every man, young and old&mdash;nay,
many a woman, too, was ready to defend hearth
and home against the foe. Colonel L&ouml;wen, whom
he had sent with 600 men to destroy the silver mines
of Kongsberg, was captured with 160 Swedes, by
the Norsemen at the parsonage in Ringerike, after
having been hoodwinked by the parson's wife,
the intrepid and quick-witted Anna Kolbj&ouml;rnsdatter.
When, suspecting that he was trapped,
L&ouml;wen put the pistol to her head, she asked,
coolly:</p>

<p>"Do you serve your king in order to kill old
women?"</p>

<p>Charles captured Christiania, but could accomplish
nothing against the fortress of Akershus. The citizens
of Frederickshald burned their town, so that it
might not afford a shelter for the Swedes against the
cannon of the fortress Fredericksteen. Here the two
brave and patriotic brothers, Peter and Hans Kolbj&ouml;rnsson,
half-brothers of Anna, distinguished themselves,
and, with their hardy volunteers, harassed the
enemy incessantly. It became evident to Charles
that he could not take the Norse fortresses without
artillery, and he expected a convoy from home
with field-cannon and other munitions of war.
But this expectation, too, failed. His fleet was
destroyed in Dynekilen by a daring deed of Tordenskjold,
the greatest naval hero that Norway has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
produced. Tordenskjold, having learned from some
fishermen that the Swedish admiral was to have a
banquet on board, that night, concluded that the
officers would scarcely be in condition for fighting,
after having risen from the table. He cried to his
lieutenant, Peter Grib:</p>

<p>"I hear that the Swedish admiral is going to have
a carousal on his fleet. Would it not be advisable
if we went with our ships and became his guests,
though unbidden? The pilot says we have wind."</p>

<p>Under a rattling fire from the shore batteries Tordenskjold
ran into Dynekilen and attacked the hostile
fleet. He was right in his supposition that the
enemy had imbibed heavily. But the danger sobered
them. After three hours of heavy cannonading,
the Swedish admiral capitulated with 44 ships
and 60 cannon. When this intelligence reached the
king, he began his retreat from Norway. But he
could not give up the thought of conquering a
country which was so poorly equipped for defence.
In 1718 he sent General Armfelt with 14,000 men
against Drontheim and moved, himself, against Fredericksteen
with 22,000. The outer redoubt was
stormed and taken and trenches were dug toward
the main fortress. In one of these trenches Charles
was standing, when he was hit in the head by a
bullet from the fortress and fell dead. Armfelt, on
receiving this intelligence, immediately retreated toward
the frontier, but lost a great number of men,
who froze and starved to death upon the mountains.
Thus the war was at an end, and peace was concluded
in Fredensborg (1720).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>The fortitude of the Norsemen had saved Denmark
from a great danger. Frederick IV. rewarded
their staunchness and intrepidity by subjecting them
to further pillaging. In order to raise money for
Danish needs, he sold all the churches of Norway to
private parties, contending that, if the people owned
them, they must have deeds and papers proving their
right of property. By this miserable quibble, he
pretended to give a show of legality to his spoliations.
The trade with Finmark he sold to three citizens
of Copenhagen, who interpreted their monopoly
as a license for unlimited extortion. The population
sank into misery and degradation.</p>

<p>During the reign of Frederick IV. lived the Norseman
Ludvig Holberg, who was born in Bergen, 1684.
He spent his life, however, in Denmark, writing a
great number of excellent comedies, in Moli&egrave;re's style,
mock-heroic poems, satires and historical works.
The life of the first half of the eighteenth century is
vividly portrayed and satirized in his writings.</p>

<p>Christian VI. (1730-1746) was an extreme pietist,
and surrounded himself with Germans who sympathized
with his morbid and lugubrious religion.
He was lavish in his expenditures, built costly palaces,
and introduced a rigid ceremonial at his court.
The one meritorious act of his reign was the issue of
a decree ordering confirmation in the Lutheran faith,
and thus indirectly compelling all classes of the
people to learn to read. Well-meant, but misdirected,
were his efforts to encourage trade and manufactures,
and positively disastrous was his decree forbidding
the inhabitants of southern Norway to import grain
from any other country than Denmark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick V. (1746-1766) was a man of kindly nature,
but limited intelligence. He opened the theatres,
which his father had closed, and abolished the
many arduous regulations for the keeping of the Sabbath.
He came within a hair of having war with
Russia, and was only saved by the murder of the
emperor, Peter III. But the great preparations he
had made necessitated an increase of taxation, which
especially fell heavily upon the poor Norse peasants.
In Bergen, the "extra-tax" led to a revolt. The peasants
broke into the city, and insulted and maltreated
the magistrates, whereupon the tax was abolished.
The Norwegian Military Academy in Christiania was
founded during the reign of this king, as also the
Academy of Sciences in Drontheim.</p>

<p>Christian VII. (1766-1808) succeeded to the throne
at the age of seventeen, and wasted his youth in the
wildest dissipation. His vitality was accordingly
used up before he reached mature manhood, and insanity
followed. During a journey abroad, he became
much attached to his body physician, a German,
named Struensee, and, after his return, made
him prime-minister, and left the government entirely
in his hands. Struensee was a man of great ability,
penetrated with the ideas of Voltaire and Rousseau,
and rather headlong in the reforms which he introduced.
The nobles and the queen-dowager, Juliana
Maria, hated him, and, by their influence, the king
was induced to sign an order for his arrest. From
the prison to the block the road was short. A favorite
of the queen-dowager, named Ove Guldberg, carried
on the government during the next twelve years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
and revoked all Struensee's liberal measures. He endeavored
to abolish the very name of Norseman, insisting
that no such nationality existed, all being citizens
of the Danish State.</p>

<p>During the reign of the last three kings, Norway
had, owing to the peace, steadily advanced in material
prosperity. The population had, in one hundred
years, nearly doubled, being, in 1767, 723,000; and
the merchant marine had, since the destruction of
the Hanseatic monopoly, grown from 50 to 1,150
ships. A class of native officials, educated at the
University of Copenhagen, began to replace the
Danish, and, by the sale of the estates of the crown,
the number of freeholders among the peasants was
largely increased.</p>

<p>As the insanity of the king made him unable to
attend to the government, his son, Crown Prince
Frederick, became, in 1784, the responsible regent,
and made an excellent selection of a premier in
Andreas Bernsdorff (1784-1797). This capable and
enlightened man piloted Denmark and Norway
safely through the stormy times of the French
Revolution. In the latter country four provincial
superior courts were established, and a peculiar institution
called "commissions of reconciliations," intended
to prevent litigation. In 1800 Denmark
had the imprudence to conclude a treaty of armed
neutrality with Russia and Sweden, with a view to
resisting the right, which England demanded, of
searching the ships of non-combatants for munitions
of war. It was the aim of England to cut France
off from all commercial intercourse with the rest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
the world and, as munitions of war were regarded not
only guns and powder, but grain and all kinds of
provisions. The Norwegian and Danish merchant
marines, which were then doing a great business as
carriers, were injured by this arbitrary interpretation.
The government was, however, not strong enough
to bid defiance to England, and after the battle
in Copenhagen harbor (April 2, 1801) Denmark
was forced to retire from the "armed neutrality."
The crown prince, Frederick, seemed, however, to
have a poor idea of the power of England, for his
policy soon again began to show symptoms of friendliness
for the emperor of the French. According to
a secret agreement between Napoleon and Alexander
of Russia (1807) at the Peace of Tilsit, the
former was to take possession of the Danish fleet,
and by means of it dispute England's dominion over
the sea. The English government soon got wind of
this plan, and immediately demanded the temporary
surrender of the Danish fleet, guaranteeing its return
as soon as peace was re&euml;stablished. When this demand
was refused, the English landed troops on Seeland
and surrounded Copenhagen, while from the sea
side they bombarded the city for three days and a
half (1807). The Danes then had no choice but to
surrender their fleet, but, owing to their resistance,
it was never returned. This second battle of Copenhagen
threw Denmark more completely into the
arms of Napoleon, and when the emperor's star declined
and set, his ally was left helpless at the mercy
of his enemies.</p>

<p>Owing to the isolation of Denmark during the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
war and the difficulty of maintaining communication,
Norway was temporarily governed by a commission,
or council of regency, under the presidency of Prince
Christian August of Augustenborg.</p>

<p>When Frederick VI. (1808-1814), at the death of
his insane father, mounted the throne, the condition
of his two countries was deplorable. His wrong-headed
policy had placed him in a position which
was wellnigh desperate. The war with England
had put an embargo upon all commerce, and famine
and misery were the result. Norway, which, without
being consulted, had been dragged into this
maze of difficulties, suffered from constant naval
attacks, to which it was, by its long coast-line, particularly
exposed. The finances were in hopeless
disorder. To add to the confusion, a war broke out
with Sweden, which, in time, had seen its advantage
in seeking an English alliance. General Armfelt
once more invaded the country, but Christian
August did not lose his courage. The Council of
Regency unfolded a heroic activity in carrying out
his measures for the defence of the land, and divisions
of Norwegian troops beat the Swedes in three
successive fights (Toverud, Trangen, and Prestebakke).
Simultaneously Sweden was attacked by
Russia, which had guaranteed to enforce the stipulations
of the Peace of Tilsit, one of which was the
blockading of the Swedish ports against the English.
But the obstinate king, Gustavus IV., would not
give his consent to this measure, in consequence of
which the Russians invaded Finland, and, after
several hotly contested engagements, drove the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
Swedes out. The result of these disasters was the
dethronement of the king and the election of his
brother, Charles XIII., as his successor. As the latter
was childless, he was induced to adopt the regent
of Norway, Prince Christian August, as his heir, and
there was thus a chance of the peaceful union of
Norway and Sweden under an able and popular
king. But, unhappily, this beloved prince died very
soon after, at a review of troops in Skaane (1809).
At the Peace of Frederickshamn, Sweden was obliged
to cede Finland to Russia, but by the Treaty of Paris
was guaranteed possession of Pomerania, on condition
of its adhering to Napoleon's so-called "continental
system." This naturally involved war with
England, which was the one unconquered and irreconcilable
enemy of the emperor; but as long as
Sweden refrained from actively aiding Napoleon,
England, which had its hands full elsewhere, assumed
an expectant attitude and exercised no hostilities.
But this semi-neutrality was far from satisfying
Napoleon. Enraged by the indecision of
Charles XIII., he again occupied Pomerania, thereby
giving Sweden a pretext for openly siding with his
enemies. Peace was concluded with England at
Oerebro (1812), and soon after Sweden joined the
great European alliance, which had for its object the
overthrow of Napoleon.</p>

<p>This change of policy was, no doubt, to a large
extent, due to Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, Prince of
Pontecorvo, who had risen from the ranks in Napoleon's
service, had become a field marshal, and
after the death of Christian August, had been made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
crown prince of Sweden (1812). At a meeting with
Alexander of Russia at Aabo, he was promised Norway,
as a reward for his adherence to the cause of
the allies; and the same promise was later repeated
by England.</p>

<p>The condition of Norway, during this period, was
aggravated by the continued blockading of her ports
by the English. In 1812 a famine broke out, and the
people were obliged to grind birch bark into flour
and bake it into bread. The depreciation of the
Danish paper money swept away the savings of
thousands of families, and demoralized all commercial
relations. Everywhere the greatest discontent
prevailed at the union with Denmark, which
had brought the country to such a strait. The tardy
grant of a charter for a Norwegian University (1811)
which had before been refused, caused a temporary
enthusiasm, but did not allay the discontent. The
political sense which seemed to have been dormant
for centuries, began to awake again, and a feeling of
independence and a desire for national self-assertion
found expression in the Society for Norway's Welfare,
(1810), in the liberal contributions to the University,
and in a sudden patriotic ferment, which pervaded the
land. The native official class came to the front as
the leaders and exponents of these political aspirations,
and rendered important service by formulating
the people's desires and leading them toward rational
aims. To be disposed of, like chattels, by foreign
powers, which had no sympathy with Norway's traditions,
nor interest in her welfare, was revolting to
their self-respect, and amid all the insecurity, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
the various moves upon the foreign diplomatic chess-board
produced, a stubborn determination to resist
to the utmost asserted itself among the thinking
classes of the people.</p>

<p>As long, however, as Norway was a mere appendage
of Denmark, it could not escape being involved
in the consequences of King Frederick's policy.
When, after Napoleon's disastrous campaign in Russia,
the allies demanded the surrender of Norway to
Sweden, the king refused and sent his cousin, Prince
Christian Frederick, to govern the country as viceroy.
But Napoleon's defeat at Leipsic and Bernadotte's
invasion of Holstein, at the head of a large
army, compelled him to come to terms. At the
Peace of Kiel, (January 14, 1814) he ceded Norway
to Sweden, and soon after released the Norsemen
from their allegiance to him, giving up all claim upon
their country for himself and his descendants.</p>

<h3>NORWAY RECOVERS HER INDEPENDENCE.</h3>


<p>The indignation which the Peace of Kiel aroused
in Norway was evidence that the Norsemen had awakened
from their long hibernating torpor and meant to
assert their rights. They were quite ready to give up
their allegiance to Frederick VI., but contended that
he had no right to dispose of it to any one else. Remembering
how their country had without its own consent,
contrary to law and treaties, become a dependency
of Denmark, they held that the sovereignty,
which Frederick renounced, reverted to the people
who were thus in position to bestow it upon whom
they chose. The viceroy, Christian Frederick, finding
this sentiment very general, refused to abide by the
decision of the powers and summoned several representative
men to meet him at Eidsvold (1814). It
had been his first intention to claim the crown
of Norway by hereditary right and to govern as
absolute monarch. But yielding to the advice of
Professor Sverdrup and other patriotic men, he
declared himself ready to accept the crown from
the people and to govern in accordance with the
constitution which the people should adopt. In order
to explore the sentiment throughout the coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>try,
the prince had travelled in the middle of winter
across the Dovre Mountain to Drontheim, and there
were many who believed that it had been his intention
to have himself crowned at once in the ancient
city of kings. In Guldbrandsdale he stopped to
read the inscription upon the monument, erected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
to commemorate the destruction of Sinclair and his
Scottish mercenaries:</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>"Woe to the Norseman whose blood does not
course more warmly through his veins when he
looks upon this stone."</p>

<p>"Are you, too," he asked the peasants who had
come to see him, "like your forefathers, willing to
sacrifice life and blood for your country?"</p>

<p>The result of the deliberations at Eidsvold was the
summoning of a diet, consisting of representatives of
the people from all parts of the country. The place
of meeting was again Eidsvold, and the number of
representatives was 112, most of whom were officials.
A constitution, which was extremely liberal in its
provisions, was adopted May 17, 1814, and Prince
Christian Frederick was elected king. Norway was
declared to be a free and independent country, but
there was a division of opinion as to whether it
should seek a union with Sweden or maintain a
king of its own. The so-called party of independence,
which was led by Judge Falsen, Professor
Sverdrup, and Captain Motzfeldt, largely outnumbered
the friends of Sweden, prominent among
whom were Count Wedel-Jarlsberg, Chamberlain
Peder Anker, Iron-master Jacob Aal, and the Rev.
Nicolai Wergeland. The latter were not desirous
of surrendering the liberty of the country, believing,
on the contrary, that liberty was securer in a union
with a stronger power. The smallness of Norway
and the inability of the people to maintain an army
adequate for its defence would, in their opinion, ultimately
make the country the prey of any foreign
power that chose to pick a quarrel with it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
The Norwegian constitution, which, slightly
amended, is yet in force, provides that:</p>

<p>1. Norway shall be a limited, hereditary, monarchy,
independent and indivisible, whose ruler shall be
called king.</p>

<p>2. The people shall exercise the legislative power
through their representatives.</p>

<p>3. The people shall alone have the right to levy
taxes through their representatives.</p>

<p>4. The king shall have the right to declare war and
to make peace.</p>

<p>5. The king shall have the right of pardon.</p>

<p>6. The judicial authority shall be separated from
the executive and the legislative power.</p>

<p>7. There shall be liberty of the press.</p>

<p>8. The evangelical Lutheran religion shall be the
religion of the state and of the king.</p>

<p>9. No personal or hereditary privileges shall, in
future, be granted to any one.</p>

<p>10. Every male citizen, irrespective of birth, station,
or property, shall be required, for a certain
length of time, to carry arms in defence of his country.</p>

<p>The representatives at Eidsvold were not unaware
that the step which they had taken involved war with
Sweden. For Bernadotte would scarcely regard the
resolutions of a deliberative assembly as an obstacle
to the possession of the prize, which he had earned
by assisting in the overthrow of Napoleon. In the
meanwhile, it was a happy circumstance to the Norsemen,
that this overthrow had not yet taken place, and
that the emperor for several months kept the army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
of the allies busy, thereby preventing Bernadotte
from turning his immediate attention to Norway. It
was a surprise to him to find the Norsemen determined
to defend their rights, as he imagined that
their long dependence upon Denmark had accustomed
them to obedience and subordination. A
letter which Charles XIII. had sent them, previous
to the diet at Eidsvold, offering them a constitution
and a Swedish viceroy, had been received with indignation,
but after the surrender of Paris (March 31st)
and the abdication of the emperor, the Napoleonic
drama seemed preliminarily at an end, and there
were no more foreign complications to prevent the
Swedes from enforcing the paragraph in the treaty
of Kiel, relating to Norway. The intelligence now
arrived that the great powers had promised Bernadotte
to compel Norway to accept the treaty, and
envoys were sent from the various courts, commanding
the Norsemen forthwith to submit themselves
unconditionally to the king of Sweden. This the
Norsemen refused to do, and soon after a Swedish
army under Bernadotte crossed the frontier. The
newly elected king now began to waver, and, being
destitute of warlike spirit, he ordered the surrender of
the fortress Fredericksteen to the Swedish fleet, without
having fired a shot in its defence. The Norwegian
army, ill-provided though it was with food
and ammunition, was eager for fight, but the faint-spirited
king showed his generalship chiefly in retreating.
A second division of the Swedish army
under Gahn was beaten in Lier by the Norwegians,
under Colonel Krebs, and after a second assault at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
Matrand was forced to retire across the frontier.
It became obvious that, without bloodshed, the conquest
of the country was not to be accomplished,
and as the Swedes, after their German campaign,
were no less desirous of peace than the Norsemen,
an armistice was concluded at Moss (August 14,
1814), in accordance with the terms of which the
king should summon an extraordinary <i>Storthing</i> or
Parliament, for the negotiation of a permanent
peace. This <i>Storthing</i>, which met October 7th,
accepted King Christian Frederick's renunciation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
the Norwegian crown and elected Charles XIII.
king, on condition of his recognizing the independence
of Norway and governing it, in accordance with
the constitution given at Eidsvold. These terms
Bernadotte accepted, in behalf of the king of Sweden
(November 4th), and swore allegiance to the constitution.
The Swedish troops then evacuated the
country, and Christian Frederick returned to Denmark,
where, at the death of his cousin, he became
king under the name of Christian VIII. The following
year a convention was negotiated with Sweden,
fixing the terms of the union (<i>Rigsakten</i>). The Bank
of Norway was established in Drontheim, and a Supreme
Court in Christiania.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

SWEDEN." title="" />
<br />
<span class="caption">CHARLES XIV. JOHN. (BERNADOTTE.) KING OF NORWAY AND

</div>

<p>To all appearances Norway had now regained her
independence. Considering the desperate position
in which the country was placed in 1814, resisting
single-handed the decree of the powers, there can be
no doubt that the terms of the union were more
favorable than there was reason to expect. For all
that, there was one feature of it which was incompatible
with the idea of independence, and that was
the presence in the capital of a Swedish viceroy
(<i>Statholder</i>), representing the authority of the king.
Bernadotte, who, at the death of Charles XIII.
(1818), succeeded to the throne under the name of
Charles XIV. John (1818-1844), scarcely regarded,
at first, the independence of Norway seriously, but
rather allowed the Norsemen to deceive themselves
with an illusion of liberty, as long as their illusion was
harmless. But he showed plainly his irritation when
he found that the <i>Storthing</i> began to oppose his meas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>ures,
and to insist upon a stricter interpretation of the
constitution. One of the first causes of contention
was the question of the payment by Norway of a
part of the Danish public debt which Charles John
had guaranteed in the treaty of Kiel. The <i>Storthing</i>
was of opinion that, as Norway had never accepted
the treaty of Kiel, it could not be bound by any of
its stipulations. A compromise was finally effected
by which the king renounced his civil list from Norway
for ten years for himself and his son, the crown
prince, and the <i>Storthing</i> of 1821 agreed to pay
about three million dollars. Simultaneously came the
struggle about the abolition of the nobility. Three
successive <i>Storthings</i> passed a law, abolishing noble
titles and privileges, and the king, who feared a conflict
with the powerful nobility of Sweden, in case he
sanctioned it, made repeated efforts to induce the
<i>Storthing</i> to abandon its position. He urged that
Norway was watched by the powers of Europe, and
that the democratic spirit which manifested itself in
its legislative assembly would arouse suspicion and
hostility abroad. The <i>Storthing</i>, however, remained
inflexible, and finally the law was promulgated,
though in a slightly modified form. Those of the
privileges of the nobility which were in conflict with
the constitution were forthwith abolished; their exemption
from taxation and all personal privileges
should cease on the demise of the nobles then living,
and should not be inherited by their descendants.
This postponed the final abolition of nobility for one
generation.</p>

<p>A number of other laws and proposals for laws,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
concerning which the king and the <i>Storthing</i> differed,
caused ill-feeling and excitement during the reign of
Charles John. And it is indeed marvellous, considering
the comparative inexperience of the representatives
in political life, that they dared present so bold
a front and insist so strenuously upon their rights.
To these intrepid men Norway owes the position she
occupies to-day. For, if they had been meek and
conciliatory, accepting gratefully what the king was
pleased to grant them, their country would inevitably
have sunk into a provincial relation to Sweden, as it
had formerly to Denmark. The manly ring and
fearless self-assertion, which resound through the debates
of those early <i>Storthings</i>, show that the ancient
strength was still surviving, and could, indeed, never
have been dead. No inert and degraded nation can
draw such representatives from its midst; and the
fact that Norway has continued to draw them, up to
the present time, shows that she is truly represented
by manliness and fearless vigor&mdash;that she is worthy
of the liberty she gained.</p>

<p>The attitude which the Norwegian <i>Storthings</i> assumed
toward the king is illustrated by the determination
with which they resisted his efforts to
extend the royal authority. Though he had been
trained in the school of the French Revolution,
Charles John was no believer in democracy or "the
rights of man." He was an able ruler, a skilful
diplomat, and a man of honorable intentions. But
he had been too little in Norway to comprehend the
spirit of the Norwegian people; and he was forced,
in order to maintain his position among his brother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
monarchs, to sympathize with the reactionary tendencies
which asserted themselves throughout Europe
after the overthrow of Napoleon. In 1821 he
proposed ten amendments to the constitution, which
were unanimously rejected by the <i>Storthing</i> of 1824.
Among these amendments was one giving the king
an absolute instead of, as formerly, a suspensive veto;
another, conferring upon him the right to appoint
the presiding officer of the <i>Storthing</i>, and a third,
authorizing him to dissolve the <i>Storthing</i> at pleasure.
The former minister of state, Christian Krogh,
gained great popularity by recommending the rejection
of these propositions, and the king's persistence
in bringing them up before several successive <i>Storthings</i>
did not secure them a more favorable reception.</p>

<span class="caption">SKEE-RUNNING; AFTER A CARTOON BY H. N. GAUSTA.</span>
</div>

<p>An eminent figure in the political struggles of
those days was the poet Henrik Wergeland, who, as
the leader of the students, persisted in celebrating
the anniversary of the constitution (May 17th) contrary
to the king's command, instead of the anniversary
of the union with Sweden (November 4th).
The king exaggerated the importance of this demonstration
and in 1829 called out troops, which dispersed,
by force of arms, the multitude celebrating the
national holiday. Wergeland, though he personally
professed reverence for the king, did not evince the
same reverence for his policy, and by his indefatigable
activity in prose and verse nourished the
defiant and aggressive patriotism of his countrymen.
In an intoxication of patriotic pride he sang the
praise of liberty and celebrated the beauties of forest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
mountain, and fjord; and a chorus of minor poets
declaimed about Norway's Lion, and the rocks of
Norway which "defied the tooth of time." There
was a good deal that was boyish and irrational in
this enthusiasm; but it was wholesome and genuine
and politically useful.</p>

<p>That Charles John did not only hold up the powers
as a scarecrow, with which to frighten the Norsemen,
but was himself restrained in his policy by a regard
for their opinion, is obvious enough. The political
ferment which, after the July Revolution (1830) in
France, spread throughout Europe and also reached
Norway, caused him much apprehension, and in
order to intimidate the steadily progressing democracy,
he suddenly dissolved the <i>Storthing</i> of 1836.
The <i>Storthing</i>, regarding this dissolution as contrary
to law, indicted the Minister of State, L&ouml;wenskjold,
before the high court of the realm (<i>Rigsret</i>), and sentenced
him to pay a fine for not having dissuaded
the king from violating the constitution. This boldness,
instead of impelling the king to further measures
of repression, induced him to make a concession.
He conciliated the Norsemen by appointing
their countryman, Count Wedel-Jarlsberg, as viceroy.
This was a great step toward real independence and
made the king justly popular. During the last years
of his life, after he had given up the hope of stemming
the tide of democracy, Charles John won the
hearts of the Norsemen and he was sincerely
mourned at his death (1844).</p>

<p>The remnants of subordination in Norway's relation
to Sweden were one by one removed during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
reign of Charles John's son, Oscar I. (1844-1859).
He gave to Norway a flag of her own, carrying, as a
symbol of the union, the blended colors of both
countries in the upper corner; and what was more, he
practically abolished the viceroyalty, though permanently
it was not abolished until 1873. Peace and
prosperity reigned in the land; the population
increased rapidly, and all industries were in a flourishing
condition. It had, hitherto, been chiefly the
official and the mercantile class which had participated
in the public life, but now the peasants, too,
began to assert themselves and to send representatives
from their own midst to the <i>Storthing</i>. The
political awakening penetrated to all strata of society;
and many sturdy figures appeared in the halls of the
legislative assembly, fresh from the plough and the
harrow. Eminent among these were Ole Gabriel
Ueland and S&ouml;ren Jaab&#339;k. A prudent moderation,
coupled with a tough tenacity of purpose, is characteristic
of these modern peasant chieftains. Good
common-sense, incorruptibility, and a stern regard
for the useful have enabled them to render valuable
service to the nation. Eloquent they are not; nor
are they, in the conventional sense, cultivated. But
they have usually, by experience, accumulated a considerable
store of facts, which in its application to the
legislative business is more valuable than loosely
acquired book-learning. Their struggles with a
rough climate and a poor soil have made them
economical; and they naturally apply their parsimonious
habits to the business of state. Being the
principal tax-payers of the country they have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
right to influence its fiscal policy; and Norway has
profited by their careful husbanding of her resources.
They know, however, when to spend as well as when
to save; and the many costly railroads, highways,
schools, and other improvements, which have come
into existence since the peasant party commanded
a majority in the <i>Storthing</i>, give evidence of a
prudent liberality and a well-balanced regard for the
public weal, which one might scarcely have expected
in people, whose chief experience is derived from the
tilling of the soil. The majority of them, however,
bring with them some practice in public life from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
home, as since the establishment of parish and municipal
councils (<i>Formandskaber</i>), (1837), the management
of local affairs is almost entirely in the hands
of local tax-payers.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">BRIDE AND GROOM.</span>
</div>

<p>The first Sleswick-Holstein war, between Germany
and Denmark, occurred during King Oscar's reign
(1848), and induced him to make a military demonstration
in Skaane; and during the following year,
when the war, after an armistice, broke out anew,
to occupy North Sleswick with Swedish and Norwegian
troops, pending the negotiations for peace. In
the Crimean War, King Oscar sided with England
and France, which, by a treaty of 1855, guaranteed
their aid, in case of hostilities with Russia.</p>

<p>King Oscar died at the age of sixty (1859), and
was succeeded by his oldest son, Charles XV. (1859-1872).
He was a chivalrous character, and endowed
with literary and artistic talents. The same good-will
toward Norway which animated his father had
been inherited by him, and all efforts, on the part of
the <i>Storthing</i>, to further the welfare of the land, were
readily seconded. The Norwegian merchant marine,
which is one of the largest in the world, carried the
flag of Norway to the remotest ports; the lumber
trade increased, and the wealth obtainable in manufactures
and commerce stimulated the energy of
Norse merchants, and quickened everywhere the
pulses of life. Religious liberty was increased by
the law concerning dissenters (1845), although there
is, in this respect, yet much to be accomplished. In
1851, the paragraph of the constitution excluding
Jews from the country was repealed, owing largely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
to the agitation commenced, some years before, by
the poet Wergeland. The telegraph was introduced,
and soon extended from the North Cape to Lindesness.
In 1869, a law was passed, making the <i>Storthings</i>
annual, instead of, as hitherto, triennial.</p>

<p>Charles XV. died in the prime of life, and, having
no sons, was succeeded (1872) by his brother, Oscar
II., who is still reigning. The progress toward a
more complete and consistent democracy, which had
been going on, since the adoption of the constitution,
has recently reached a crisis, which might have had
disastrous consequences, if the king had not wisely
made concessions to the parliamentary majority.
There were really two points at issue, viz., the absolute
veto in constitutional questions and the control
of the government. As regards the former, the king
held that the Norwegian constitution was a contract
between him and the Norwegian people, prescribing
the terms of the union. Accordingly, it could not
be altered without the consent of both parties. He
had, therefore, the right to insist upon the terms of
the contract, and to forbid any alteration of it, that
did not meet with his approval. There can be no
doubt but that legally this point was well taken; and
the faculty of law in the University sustained the
king's position. Another question is, whether such
a contract, if eternally enforced, would not cripple
the nation's progress, and in time become as great a
curse, as once it had been a blessing. If the framers
of the constitution, when they submitted it to Charles
John, failed to provide for its amendment, they committed
a serious error, which may, perhaps, be bind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>ing
upon their descendants, in point of law, but
scarcely in point of equity. No constitution, however
excellent, is fitting for all times; and the constitution
of Eidsvold is no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>This struggle over the absolute veto was occasioned
by the king's refusal to sanction a law, passed
by three successive <i>Storthings</i>, admitting the cabinet
ministers to participation in the debates of the house,
so as to establish a closer <i>rapport</i> between the people
and the government. This seemed especially
desirable, as long as the king and a division of the
cabinet were resident in Stockholm, and, accordingly,
were in danger of losing sight of the needs of the
people whom they were governing. The king declared
himself ready to sign this law, if the ministers
were given the right to vote, and the right was
granted him to dissolve the <i>Storthing</i> at will. It
seemed to him a disturbance of the balance of power
to introduce one feature of English parliamentarism,
giving an advantage to the legislature, without also
granting the other, which enabled the executive to
exert a restraining influence. The <i>Storthing</i> was,
however, unwilling to grant this right, being of opinion
that there was no need of governmental restraint,
where elections were triennial. The ministry, Selmer,
which maintained the attitude here ascribed to the
king, was impeached by the <i>Storthing</i> before the
high court of the realm, for having refused to promulgate
the law concerning the participation of the
ministers in the deliberations of the house, and for
failing, in other points, to carry out the will of the
<i>Storthing</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">OSCAR II.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>

<p>The other phase of the question was scarcely less
important. A certain antagonism had early developed
itself between the official class, which had been
accustomed to take the lead in public affairs, and the
peasantry, which became every year more conscious
of its power. The king, who is naturally conservative,
chose his advisers from those, whose political
views accorded with his own, irrespective of parliamentary
majorities. The constitution did not
limit his liberty of choice, and the <i>Storthing</i> could
scarcely do it, without passing an amendment,
which he would be sure to veto. The conservative
ministry, Stang, conducted the government for many
years with a hostile majority in the <i>Storthing</i>, and
the ministry, Selmer, which succeeded it (1880), had
even less popular support. The result was a deadlock;
legislative business threatened to come to a
standstill. The impeachment and conviction of Mr.
Selmer and his colleagues brought a fresh ministry
of officials into power, which, after a few months, resigned.
The king then sent for Mr. Sverdrup, the
leader of the "left," or liberal party, and effected a
compromise, in accordance with which he agreed to
sanction the law in question, and to summon a ministry,
representing the party of the majority, without,
however, surrendering, in principle, his right to an
absolute veto in constitutional questions. Since then
the executive and the legislative power have worked
together in harmony, and the former good relation
between the king and the people has been in a
measure re-established.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above, that Norway has,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
through the conflicts of seventy years, gradually attained
to perfect independence and equality with the
brother kingdom. All attempts to amalgamate the
two nations have failed, and have, long since, been
abandoned. Politically, the person of the king expresses
the union. He is king of Norway and he is
king of Sweden, but he governs each country in
accordance with its own laws and through distinct
and separate ministries. Each country has its own
parliament; no Swede holds office in Norway, and
no Norseman in Sweden. The only offices which
are open to citizens of both countries are those of
the diplomatic and consular service. The general
sentiment in Norway is opposed to a closer union.
A stubborn insistence upon every feature of national
distinctness has characterized the people, since the
separation from Denmark.</p>

<p>Thus an effort has been made to get rid of the
"union mark" in the Norwegian flag; because it
seemed vaguely to hint at a provincial relation. A
separate literature has sprung up in the Norse dialects
(<i>Maalstr&auml;v</i>), because the Danish, which is yet
spoken, with some modifications, by the cultivated
classes, is a reminder of the period of degradation,
and is not the language of the people. Popular
high schools, aiming to build the intellectual life of
the people upon a strictly national basis, have been
started by devoted and patriotic men, in nearly all
the provincial parishes, and have produced excellent
results. The national literature, under the lead of
men like Bj&ouml;rnstjerne Bj&ouml;rnson, and Henrik Ibsen,
is moving in the same direction, its language being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
continually enriched from the dialects, and its themes
largely drawn from the ancient sagas and the life of
the people. The aggressive and declamatory patriotism
of Wergeland, and the &aelig;sthetic and more cosmopolitan
patriotism of his opponent, Welhaven, seem
equally alien to the Norsemen of to-day. The frank
national self-assertion of the present poets is that of
a people, proud of its past, and secure in its national
existence. The Norseman, having obtained what is
his due, has cause for jealousy neither of Sweden nor
of Denmark.</p>

<p>In an age when strength, bravery, and an adventurous
spirit made a nation eminent, Norway played
a great r&ocirc;le upon the arena of the world, founding
and destroying kingdoms, mingling her vigorous
blood with that of other nations, and infusing her
love of liberty, restrained by law, into their souls.
Since powder and modern strategy have subordinated
heroism to discipline and numbers, Norway
must resign herself to the fate which her numerical
weakness imposes upon her. A people of scarcely
two millions can cut no very great figure in the
world, as it is now constituted. It must either rest
upon its laurels or win new ones in other fields. As
the militant organization of society, with its needless
bloodshed and oppression, slowly yields to the industrial,
history will find another gauge of merit than
that of Krupp guns and heavy battalions. Then,
perhaps, there will again be a chance for small nations
to assert themselves.</p>

<p>Norway has made a beginning in this direction by
her contributions, during recent years, to science and

literature. The astronomer Hansteen (d. 1873), the
mathematicians Abel and Sophus Lie, the zo&ouml;logist
Sars, the historians Munch, Keyser, Sars, and Storm,
and the philologist Ivar Aason, have gained recognition,
beyond the boundaries of their own country.
The painters Tidemand (d. 1876) and Gude have
interpreted in colors the poetry of Norse popular
life and scenery. The musicians Ole Bull (d. 1880),
Nordraak, and Grieg have made the melancholy
strains of their native mountains resound through
the concert-halls of Paris and London, and the
poets Bj&ouml;rnson, Ibsen, Jonas Lie, and Alexander
Kielland have made Norway known to the world
and the world known to Norway. They have broken
down the wall which so long hedged in their country,
and excluded it from the intellectual life of Europe.</p>

<p>The Story of the Nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS</span> take pleasure in
announcing that they have in course of publication a
series of historical studies, intended to present in a
graphic manner the stories of the different nations that
have attained prominence in history.</p>

<p>In the story form the current of each national life will
be distinctly indicated, and its picturesque and noteworthy
periods and episodes will be presented for the reader in
their philosophical relation to each other as well as to
universal history.</p>

<p>It is the plan of the writers of the different volumes
to enter into the real life of the peoples, and to bring
them before the reader as they actually lived, labored, and
struggled&mdash;as they studied and wrote, and as they amused
themselves. In carrying out this plan, the myths, with
which the history of all lands begins, will not be overlooked,
though these will be carefully distinguished from
the actual history, so far as the labors of the accepted
historical authorities have resulted in definite conclusions.</p>

<p>The subjects of the different volumes will be planned
to cover connecting and, as far as possible, consecutive
epochs or periods, so that the set when completed will
present in a comprehensive narrative the chief events in
the great <span class="smcap">Story of the Nations</span>; but it will, of course,
not always prove practicable to issue the several volumes
in their chronological order.</p>

<p>The "Stories" are printed in good readable type, and
in handsome 12mo form. They are adequately illustrated
and furnished with maps and indexes. They are sold
separately at a price of $1.50 each.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Some of the Comments Received</span>:</p>

<p><i>Extracts from Letters</i>:</p>

<p>FROM THE RT. REV. HENRY C. POTTER, D.D., LL.D., NEW
YORK.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you on the issue of a work which, I
am sure, will find a wide welcome, and the excellent
features of which make it of permanent value."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span></p>

<p>FROM THE REV. HOWARD CROSBY, D.D., NEW YORK.</p>

<p>"The 'Scriptures for Young Readers' is admirably
conceived and admirably executed. It is the Bible story
in Bible words.... It is the work of devout and
scholarly men, and will prove a help to Bible study. I
have examined it with great satisfaction, and have
found on almost every page the marks of original investigation
and wise judgment."</p>

<p>FROM PREST. JULIUS H. SEELYE, D.D., LL.D., AMHERST,
MASS.</p>

<p>"Its excellence for its purpose has surprised me, and
I give it my hearty commendation."</p>

<p>FROM PROF. HENRY THAYER, D.D., CAMBRIDGE, MASS.</p>

<p>"It more than meets my expectations; in fact, is so
attractive that I have set myself to its perusal from end
to end."</p>

<p>FROM PREST. M. B. ANDERSON, D.D., LL.D., ROCHESTER, N. Y.</p>

<p>"The work seems to me adapted to be useful in the
education of the young in Biblical history and the great
moral truths embodied in it."</p>

<p>FROM PREST. GEO. WILLIAMSON SMITH, D.D., TRINITY
COLLEGE, HARTFORD, CONN.</p>

<p>"I have carefully examined the first volume of the
'Scriptures for Young Readers,' and am deeply impressed
by the learning and skill shown by the authors.
They undertook a very difficult work, and have accomplished
it in a scholarly manner. If interest in the book
is an evidence of youth, many will find from reading this
'Introduction to the Study of the Bible' that they are
not as old as they supposed they were."</p>
